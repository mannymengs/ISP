My first was working at Coffee Pond Photography.  Coffee Pond is a small business that focuses on taking portraits and selling them.  They take photos mostly of schools, but also of families and major events, like weddings or parties.  Schools generate a huge amount of their profit, ordering individual photos, ID photos, and yearbooks.  The profit from schools is mostly parents ordering prints of their children, as well as ordering yearbooks from the school.  My part in this was mostly office, administrative work.  I prepared camera kits, entered data into the system, charged credit cards, and a few other odd jobs.  Along with this, I went to a few photo shoots, two ID shoots, two yearbook/facebook shoots, and two all school shoots.  On most of these I just assisted the photographer by filling out forms.  One of the shoots I did by myself.</p><p>The second half of my ISP was an independent photography project.  I went around and took photos inside and outside of churches in Boston and in Newton.  I spent about an hour or two at each church, taking photos, then went home to edit and sort through the pictures I took.</p>','<p>The Coffee Pond side of my ISP was by far much less rewarding than my photo project.  I originally wanted to do something with photography because I love taking photos and finding new and interesting ways of viewing the world.  However, working at Coffee Pond coordinated with almost none of my interests.  A majority of the time I spent there was on the computer, simply entering emails into a giant excel document.  The type of photography that Coffee Pond deals in is also completely different than the type I love.  ID photos and photos for the yearbooks are uninteresting, stagnant.  The subject is asked to sit in one spot and smile, and that’s that.  There is no artistry in this business.  The only photographical concern is the lighting and position of the subject.  There is no creative license in shooting ID photos.</p><p>However, it was interesting to get a view into the workings of a small business: how their business model works, where the profit comes from, whom else the company has to deal with.  Because the business relies on parents ordering prints, the only outside costs are the photographer’s salary and minimal travel expenses.  However, because Coffee Pond does not own its own printing company, there is much dealing with and costs involving an outside publishing company.</p><p>From this project, I learned about a small business, but mostly what I didn’t want to do in life.  While at Coffee Pond, I was working in a small office, doing mindless data entry, all for a project in which I have little to no interest.  I would not recommend this project alone to any incoming senior.  The rewards and information was minimal.  I did not get a lot out of this project.</p><p>My independent photography project, however, was incredibly more rewarding.  The days where I did this project were relaxing and fun.  I already take my camera almost anywhere I go.  I love taking photos creatively and seeing these different angles printed on paper.  To have my only responsibility for the day to be taking photos of beautiful churches was amazing.  I was able to spend time outside or in a very quiet inviting environment exclusively.  This project was so worthwhile because of the fact that I love taking photos.</p><p>The most challenging part of this project was finding ample time to actually go out and get the photos I needed for my project.  This was due to two factors:  my weekday work at Coffee Pond, and school commitments.  Because of class meetings, extracurriculars, and mostly working on the musical, my schedule was rather packed.  However, because of the weekends and afternoons, I was able to get a good amount of photos.</p><p>In doing my own comprehensive photography essay, I’ve learned what it takes to put together a legitimate portfolio.  Many of my photos have a subject matter that I just found interesting or beautiful.  But in doing this essay, I know what it’s like to really focus on one theme, one unifying factor.  No professional’s portfolio is full of random, disconnected shots.  I’ve learned how to put together a series of connected, unified photos, a skill I will need if I want to pursue photography in any form after graduation.</p><p>Had I only done this independent photography essay, my ISP time would have been much more rewarding.  Then I could’ve spent five almost full days a week taking photos of churches.  Coffee Pond took away about 25 hours a week, that I could’ve been spending on this instead.  That way, the final essay would have been bigger and more fleshed out.  However, despite the smaller amount of time I had for this project, I still greatly enjoyed the many hours I spent shooting and editing.  I would definitely suggest this project to any senior that was already into photography.  It is not very stressful, yet comes with huge rewards.  At least for me, and anyone else who loves photography, no time spent with a camera in hand is wasted time.</p>');

While with the grounds crew, I assisted in preparing BC’s baseball, softball, and football practice fields to be used by their teams for both practice and games.  While in the ticketing office, I assisted in the completion of a variety of projects designed to prepare for the arrival of their full time interns this summer and to attract group and season ticket sales for football games.

Each of the three departments that I worked in all provided a unique perspective on this preparation, and were distinct enough that going to my ISP remained interesting throughout the entire time that I worked there.  Although interesting, none of the work that I did was necessarily very challenging.  However, the most difficult thing that I had to do while working at BC was calling football season ticket holders to see if they were going to renew for the fall, as at first it was difficult to sound casual while still having a scripted plan for the call.</p><p>This project gave me a clearer picture as to what it is like to work in the sports entertainment industry, as I was able to get a closer look of a couple of the fields that make up this large business.  Having worked in both grounds keeping and ticket sales, I learned quickly that they would not be two fields which I would be very interested in going into as a career.  However, a lot of the work that the External Operations department does, specifically their role in negotiating sponsorship agreements and handling all licensing for BC seemed very interesting.  However, I was not fully able to get a sense of this work, as the people in the department did not have much for me to do beyond helping out with office management and running errands throughout BC for them.  Most of what I learned during my time in that department came from talking to the employees about what their job entails.</p><p>Based on my experience, I would strongly recommend this project for future RL seniors who share my interests in athletics and athletic entertainment.  Although I sometimes was confined to trivial office organizing, the opportunity to simply get to see the behind the scenes work in a major athletic enterprise was ultimately what was most interesting to me.  For anyone who has this same interest, I believe that they would greatly enjoy the same project that I have just finished.  Additionally, all of the people whom I worked for and worked with while at BC were all very friendly and welcoming, and seemed glad that I was both there helping them out and interested in their profession.  This atmosphere made my time at BC much more enjoyable, as it was much easier to work for people whom I enjoyed on both a personal and professional level.</p>');

When given the opportunity to do nearly anything I wanted for 5 weeks, I knew I wanted to do something both that I would be eager to attend everyday and that I could look back upon as a meaningful learning experience. Reflecting on this, I realized that I achieved both goals by interning in the probation office. My day-to-day activities included checking everyone in in the morning, and then working alongside the probation department in the courtroom all afternoon.</p>','<p>I started my day off by working in the intake office until 9:30. Anybody coming into the court had to check in in this office. There were several different sessions going on each day, and depending on the session that the person belonged to, they had to fill out different paperwork. For example during one particular day, there were three different sessions going on. The first session courtroom, the biggest of all the courtrooms, was holding arraignments, default removals, and new summons. The people getting arraigned had been arrested either the night before or recently and were coming to hear their charges. Default removals were for people who needed to remove a warrant that was out for their arrest. Summons were people who were asked to come to the court for various reasons. If you were heading to this court room, you had to fill out an intake form, which took down basic information. If you needed the court to appoint an attorney, then they had to fill out further paperwork.</p><p>On this day, the other two sessions were holding pretrial conferences and jury trials. If you were heading to these courts, then normally you did not need to fill out paperwork because you had already been arraigned. This project was rewarding because of all the interesting people I met and the stories I heard. This project was challenging because I had to constantly deal with often drunk, rowdy people who were pissed off at the world and took it out on me. I learned how to compose myself in a legitimate working environment, as well as valuable lessons of stern punishment for many different crimes. This project could have been more rewarding, if I had a longer period to do it. I did not really get settled until my third week and therefore I was not able to make as much progress as I would have liked. I would recommend this project because it is both exciting and interesting. I learned a lot about the judicial system, especially on the probation side, and I also met some very interesting people.</p>');

Brooks Charter School in Roslindale.  After dropping my brother off at RL, I commuted ten minutes, at most, to the school right near Roslindale center and arrived at 8:00 a.m. every morning.  I spent most of my time with two different fifth grade classes.  After arriving every day I would make my way to Ms. Kirby"s classroom where the students were finishing up their morning work and I helped in any way that was needed.  Then some days I observed Ms. Kirby teach the math lesson where on other days I performed various tasks for teachers such as organizing packets, cutting papers, and other meticulous tasks. Following that, the students had their writing period where they were working on five paragraph essays based on books they read.  Each day I met with three or four different students to go over each paragraph and correct grammar mistakes and point out any structural mistakes.  After the writing period was reading.  During this time all the fifth grade students went into one room for reading.  Some days I observed the teacher read aloud and analyze the text with the students where other days I performed tasks for teachers.  Then I helped in Ms. Thornton"s room with the math period.  Some days I worked with specific students one on one, and other days I supervised groups of students and checked their work frequently.  Also, a few days prior to their science MCAS, I stayed later and helped with the science period and occasionally joined the students for recess.  On the norm I left the school at 11:30 and some days at 2:00.</p><p>What I found rewarding about this project was having the chance to offer my knowledge and academic skills to help other students.  It was really something to have the chance to approach a student who is confused or lost and after helping them, leave them knowing they have mastered and understood that concept.  I got to see that my work was really appreciated as all the students wrote thoughtful thank you and good luck cards to me that I found extremely impressive.</p><p>One challenging aspect of the project was being patient with the students.  They were learning subjects in math that I had taken for granted and had not remembered learning the basics.  There were also students who simply did not have a good work ethic.  At times I found myself alongside students who simply refused to think of a topic sentence for their next paragraph or who would just not sit still.  It was a good experience to practice patience in the whole grand scheme of teaching and helping the students grasp concepts.</p><p>I went into this project not really excited and telling myself that I do not enjoy working with little kids.  However, when it was all said and done, I ended up enjoying the project.  After getting to know the children and familiarizing myself with the teachers and the school environment, I felt that I fit in.  I found that I can work with younger children quite well as many enjoyed my presence.  I believe the project could have been more rewarding if I used my time better.  Sometimes I found myself just sitting in a classroom listening to a teacher and being put to sleep.  If there was always something to do, such as a project that could be done in my spare time, the entire experience would be more rewarding.</p><p>I would  recommend this project.  It is a good way to lend one"s service and skills to younger children just a few minutes down the street from our school.  I had fun and felt it was a good use of my five weeks.</p>');

After six years at RL we had not been able to practice or pursue production of music as much as we wanted, however this project allowed us to pursue this. We learned a lot from working with FL Studios everyday and being able to sit down and actually tackle the program. Also hearing the final product of something you have made additionally was an rewarding feeling. There were many challenging aspects to the project, one of them being lack of acapellas online. We both had many great ideas about songs we wanted to remix however due to the lack of either quality or absence online we were unable to pursue these songs. Limited programs also added to challenged. We wanted to use Logic and Ableton however both are very expensive and so we could not harness our full potential sometimes. Long hours in the studio also added to the stress and sometimes we had to take breaks after listening to the same repeated song for a couple hours. Roadblocks as previously mentioned drew frustration and angst also because sometimes our creativity could not be harnessed. In this experience we found our musical capabilities as well and our potential to make and produce music. We learned that i am capable of doing something like this. Additionally we both learned to make a final product by ourselves with our own unique style without any drawn finish line for us to see. Music like oil painting can always be added and subtracted and we both learned when to cut short parts and add to make our own unique style. The project would be more rewarding to us if we could have worked in an actual studio. Also if we had had the resources of Apple Logic, Ableton and other programs which would have lead to a finer and more polished sound. Logic for example is extremely well adapt with vocals and making them crystal clear. We would recommend this project to anyone who has always had an interest in music but haven"t had the time or opportunity to delve deeper into it because of commitments with school. It is for anyone wanting to learn about the art of making music and who would want to act upon their own imagination and creativity constructively. It is also very useful and helpful to work on your own time where their is no outside force dictating how you do something. In a way you have a lot more responsibility to do and finish the project without slacking off. We would not recommend this project to anyone who thinks it would be any easy ISP because in making quality sound you must put in countless hours fine-tuning and brushing up each individual sound and part of the song.</p>');

We cut out the pieces from two 4x8 plywood sheets during the first week, then spent the next few weeks joining them and struggling to bend the plywood into the shape of a proper hull. After some improvisation, we succeeded in securing all of the pieces. That left us two weeks during which we plugged holes using an epoxy-flour putty, built two seats, and painted the skiff a lovely shade of red.</p>','<p>Our project was rewarding because it was a break from normal RL life. Working with one’s hands is a valuable skill, but not one taught at a college prep school. I certainly relished the opportunity to do something that I might never have the chance to do again, rather than interning in the professional world. Of course, the end result of the project – a functional boat – was a reward in and of itself. Having a tangible product of which I could be proud made the project all that more enjoyable.</p><p>Time management was a significant challenge for Stephen and myself. We often neglected to plan ahead, and found ourselves waiting idly for epoxy to dry or taking multiple trips to Home Depot in a single day. Our off-campus advisor helped us through this particular challenge, reminding us to read ahead in the instructions and structure our days beforehand.</p><p>Other problems arose when the instructions we found did not quite work. Several times the plans called for screws when screws simply would not hold. The solution, then, was improvisation – an invaluable skill in any field. Stephen and I were able to research or invent other techniques for securing pieces. The necessity of adapting and rethinking, although bothersome, was ultimately beneficial to the two of us.</p><p>One regret I have is that Stephen and I did not visit an RL alumnus who builds boats for a living on Martha’s Vineyard. It was too difficult to schedule with spring sports and musical rehearsals, but I would recommend that any future boat-builders seize the opportunity, since I imagine it would be a fascinating and exciting experience.</p><p>I would certainly recommend this project to future RL seniors. It was a refreshing change of pace from the stress of RL and professional life. I was able to spend five weeks working with a close friend. I learned a lot about carpentry, and it was definitely nice to make my own schedule. On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed the five weeks I spent constructing a skiff.</p>');

My daily tasks varied quite a bit, so I could be exposed to many different areas of the organization. My off-campus advisor, and boss, was Jon Dienstag who is the Special Assistant to Larry Lucchino, the President and CEO. Most of what I did revolved around Larry’s work. I opened a lot of his fan mail, and drafted the return letters for him. I also prepared some brief summaries for his speaking engagements. The strangest of my tasks was going through and updating his Christmas card list. Beyond Larry, I worked with Travis Patterson in the mailroom. My desk was right next to his, so I helped him out with random things that he needed a hand on. Also seated near me was Sarah Coffin who is a Historical Archivist. Sometimes I would help her out as she scanned old photos into the database, and made records of all sorts of memorabilia. The last thing that I worked on was the preparation for Fenway Park’s 100th anniversary in 2012. This involved responding to fans’ suggestions, and doing research on how other organizations celebrated important milestones.</p>','<p>Over the course of my five weeks at Fenway Park, I think the most rewarding part was being exposed to how a sports team runs. I have always been interested in professional sports, and to be lucky enough to have this behind-the-scenes look at the Red Sox was eye opening. The most challenging aspect of my project was avoiding monotony. The tasks that I was given were not especially difficult, but they got repetitive towards the end. While I am certainly grateful to have had this wonderful opportunity, I think I was expecting to do some more exciting tasks with the players, or things of that nature. I was probably naïve in thinking that, but overall I had a lot of fun with the Red Sox and learned a lot.</p><p>In terms of what I learned about myself, I discovered that getting involved with a professional sports team would be an awesome career. Nearly all of the time, Fenway Park is just a regular office building, except for when there is a home game. Having that in your workplace was really cool, and something I could see myself enjoying in the future. If I had to pick something to make the project more rewarding for me, I think I should have picked Mr. Lucchino’s brain a little bit more. Obviously as a lowly intern, I was pretty intimidated by the President of the Boston Red Sox.

I got an internship designed as a summer program, but Dawn Jennings, my off campus advisor, told me that I could also work at State Street for my ISP. What was supposed to be my first week, my off campus advisor, Dawn Jennings, told me that she was not prepared for me to arrive and needed me to start the following week. The following week, she asked me to come in on Tuesday to fill out paper work. On Wednesday, I started my internship in Quincy at an Accountant Training Program for new-hires.

I was not the top priority of my off campus advisor. During my time in the accountant-training program, my biggest challenge was trying to catch up and understand the material being taught. All the other new-hires taking the class were at least a couple of years out of graduate school and had already studied accounting. Some aspect of the material I learned was confusing, and to add to my confusion, I came to the program on the third day of a ten-day session. In addition, I was only able to attend the program in the mornings because I had to go to tennis practice in the afternoons. Everything I missed during class was my responsibility to learn, and no one was there to tell me what I needed to do or learn.</p><p>I would not recommend doing this project for an ISP. I would recommend this project for a summer internship, but not as an ISP, because my work was not as rewarding as I hoped. The internship could have been more rewarding in three ways. First, my off campus advisor could have been better organized so that I could have been there for the beginning of the training program, as opposed to the third day into the program. Second, during my time in training, I did not have enough training to fully understand what was being taught. I entered the training midsession, and I had to leave early every day to get back to school for tennis, which left me behind the rest of the class. Third, I planned to work in Finance, but I ended up working in Human Resources because there weren’t any openings for interns in Finance. I wished they had told me that at the outset.</p><p>Nonetheless, I did learn a lot during the accountant training and even during my time in Human Resources.

Hale is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving 1100 acres of land and making it accessible to the public. Hale runs various programs including a summer camp, beach, and various team building activities. At Hale I worked with Jay Walsh, the Environmental Resource Manager, to help him accomplish a myriad of tasks. A central focus of the work was to make sure the Hale water system was clean and drinkable. We drove around checking wells, measuring chemical content, and delivering samples to labs. I also did various work around the reservation such as raking, spreading mulch, and laminating signs. As a non-profit, Hale’s budget is pretty low and there’s always a great deal that needs to get done; I was always busy and constantly sought after by other Hale staff for help on their projects. It was interesting to see how such an operation was run, with everyone pitching in to help each other. </p>','<p>Working at Hale was very rewarding because I could tell that I was making a difference. With their maintenance department somewhat understaffed, there was a huge amount of work that needed to be done and not enough people to do it. Along with managing the camp’s environmental resources, Jay coordinated most of the volunteer efforts for Hale, and I learned to appreciate how instrumental they were to the organization. As one volunteer I felt I was making a significant difference, so when 50 volunteers worked for a day the results were amazing. However, even while spending the majority of the time working by myself, I could see a huge amount of work get done. </p><p>Working by myself for most of the time was also one of the more challenging aspects of the ISP. When assigned with large projects to do, it was a little daunting to begin working knowing that I would need to do everything by myself. Occasionally, when Mr. Walsh was busy and I needed to work by myself for most of the day, it got pretty lonely. However, I learned that I’m able to remain productive with no one working with me or checking in on me, and stay motivated and focused on my goal. In the future, however, I’d recommend anyone considering doing this ISP to do it with a friend. There’s easily enough work for multiple people and it would have made many of the tasks far more enjoyable. </p>');

While Mr. Silver was instrumental in helping us with the filming and writing side of our project, giving us advice on our raw footage, shot angles and material, Mr. Piper, our on-campus advisor helped us with the technical side of everything. We took the first week of our ISP, as well as the weeks leading up to that week, to write our script and familiarize ourselves with the machinery that we would be using, and then filmed when we could get enough people to one place at one time. We would edit everything in the days following the filming to make sure that we stayed on schedule.</p>','<p>What I found most rewarding about my project was the finished product.

I also now have the experience to do a project that is similar to this in the future, whether for a college course or for fun.</p><p>The most challenging thing about our project was getting everyone together and to have a productive filming session. Because every member of the cast was also on their ISPs, with some having to work six hours a day every day, our filming time was severely limited in that we could only really do it on the weekends. There are some scenes in the film in which only four characters appear because we didn’t have the other people there due to some conflict, ISP related or otherwise.</p><p>I learned that being creative is one of my favorite things to do. I’ve always loved performing and writing, but being able to experience a new media such as film has really taught me that anything creative, no matter what it is, will be enjoyable for me.</p><p>This project could have been more rewarding for me if we had been able to do everything that we set out to do. Because of repeated absences we couldn’t film some scenes, develop characters and even had to make some personnel changes along the way. If we had been able to develop each character the way we had set out to at the beginning, the film would make more sense, and would be more enjoyable to watch, both from the audiences perspective and my own.</p><p>I would recommend this project to anyone who has the means to do it. If a future student has the necessary equipment, the right attitude and can get ahead on writing and filming, I would definitely suggest that they pursue a project in film. Having a non-structured ISP, like ours, let us enjoy our time away from classes to the fullest and have an end product that we are both very proud of.</p>');

My main project was to research a clothing retail company (American Eagle Outfitters) and come to a conclusion that it was either in a good or bad position in the market. Working off of the framework provided by Michael Porter’s “The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy,” I analyzed the different elements of American Eagle and presented my findings to the Adage analysts. About half of my time was spent doing research in the office while the other half was spent doing outside research such as observing stores at malls and conducting a Facebook poll to get a sense for our generation’s clothing preferences. I also got to briefly explore the client-relations side of the company’s operations, sitting in on a conference call with potential clients and visiting a client to get their perspective on Adage.</p>','<p>The most rewarding part of the project was learning how to apply the various theories that we had learned in Economics to a real-world scenario. In class we had learned a variety of theories regarding to markets in general and the operation of individual firms and this project allowed us to synthesize these elements into an analysis of a company which is the first step for any industry analyst. It was also rewarding to learn this thought process for industry analysis that eventually led us to a conclusion that was confirmed by the firm’s professional analysts. The most challenging part of the project was finding a way to take all of the data that we had collected and use it to support a conclusion. Our research provided us with lots of potential graphs and charts ranging from gender stratified competition to comparison shopping and the hardest part of the project was pulling these separate elements together to form a cohesive argument.</p><p>I learned that I have the basic skills to confront real-world challenges and a solid thought process to solve them. For the most part, we was encouraged to work independently on the project, working on our own intuition and only checking in with the analysts without having them drag us along. The project could have been more rewarding if I had more experience in the clothing market and was a bigger shopper thus giving me a better introductory view to the industry trends.</p><p>I would recommend this project because I think it was a great way to experience firsthand what goes on in an interesting and exciting field. After taking Economics this year, I became really interested in the subject and this project provided me with an opportunity to further explore an application of economics in the real world. I enjoyed the fact that the project was designed to keep us engaged and had us doing our own research instead of simply shadowing an analyst and doing his or her paperwork. The atmosphere at Adage was also very relaxed and calm, providing a great enjoyable setting to learn from experienced analysts and explore the field.</p>');

He and his partner, Erin, have an office in Newton, which is where I spent the first few weeks of my ISP. During this time I was essentially Adam’s assistant as he prepared for the event he was going to manage, the Earthfest Concert for Radio 92.9. I spent most of my office days working on “The Book”, what became a 40 page document containing any and all information Adam might need to know for Earthfest. This came out of client or sponsor request forms, artist’s contracts or requests, parking and vehicle lists, and other sheets and schedules. Then, as Earthfest approached, my job moved from the office in Newton to the DCR Hatch Memorial Shell, in Boston right on the Charles River. This was the site of the concert. I quickly went from a mere assistant to someone with real responsibilities. During the set-up for the concert, we employed prison inmates as a form of cheap labor to move and build the tents, tables, and other parts of the sponsor booths and exhibits. I was put in charge of these workers as well as a team from Radio 92.9 for the set-up. Then, on the day of the concert, my responsibility was the Kids’ Area and Kids’ Stage. I helped all the clients in the Kids’ Section of the festival have everything they needed for the day, and also needed to make sure the Kids’ Artists’ performances all ran smoothly.</p>','<p>During the last week or two of my project, I inherited a lot of responsibility. This was challenging but ultimately rewarding, because while there was real pressure to keep everything under control and running smoothly, it allowed me to take ownership of the situation. I feel as though I really learned how to keep my cool under pressure, and to control the things I am able to while not dwelling on the things I can’t. This project was overall a pretty rewarding experience. I was able to see the payoff of my first few weeks in the office, as The Book was an essential tool for everyone during the set-up and the concert itself. It was also rewarding during the concert, watching the Artists as most everything ran according to plan. I would recommend this project to others, with the warning that it will come with a lot of responsibility, but also with the assurance that this responsibility is also rewarding.</p>');

In return for occasional lessons and information learned along the way, we worked for Jay Cadero, our off-campus advisor, in carrying out his projects. As he runs a one-man shop, we got a lot of hands-on experience. Our daily routine often consisted of completing projects such as fences and banisters to be sold. We also spearheaded the reconstruction of steel patio furniture. On lighter mornings, Jay took the time to show us how to forge such things as barn hooks and ornamental leaves. By both participating in and observing the various stages of creating projects from scratch, we have gained both a moderate competence in and an appreciation for iron work and blacksmithing.</p>','<p>The fact that I got to assist in the production of fences and banisters was the most rewarding part of the ISP. We took long pieces of iron stock, and through various processes we were able to create a final product that looked incredible, and that will grace someone’s home or business for years to come. As I stated before, Mr. Cadero runs a one-man shop. We were thus an instrumental part in the construction. Furthermore, now as I pass ornamental railings and fences in the street, I can look at whomever I am with and confidently say, “I could do that.”</p><p>The most challenging aspect of our project was actually the measuring. Although many projects do not have to be precise, most of those we worked on did. For example, one railing was going to be wedged into a space between a wall and a post. It could not be a fraction of an inch too long, as it would then be unable to fit in the space. Furthermore, as it was going to be drilled into the wall on both sides, it could not be too short either. We therefore had to be extremely meticulous in measuring and cutting the pieces of metal.</p><p>This project has shown me that I still enjoy producing art. Just as in art class freshman and junior years, I have found it very satisfying to create something aesthetically pleasing from nothing at all, whether with a paintbrush or with a forge.</p><p>Although we did create ornamental leaves and barn hooks, we did not complete the candlesticks which Thato and I were designing and producing on our own. As Memorial Day approach, customers began insisting that their projects be completed, so we had to work exclusively in that arena for the last few weeks. Completing the candle sticks would have made for an even more rewarding experience.</p><p>I would absolutely recommend this project. RL is a very intellectual school, with little opportunity for “hands on” work (except for Habitat Builds). This project was therefore a great change of pace, and gave me an entirely new appreciation for a subject that I had little interest in before. I would only advise that the senior live near the shop, because driving to and from Walpole in the respective rush hours is not much fun.</p>');

A year ago I had come up with the idea of writing a detailed, sophisticated picture book about the most interesting individuals that I had encountered during my “outside of school” study of the Medieval ages. For the project I wrote the biographies for only three knights, but the entire book will hopefully be somewhere around 25 biographies. I also drew the pictures for two of them, and commissioned my older brother to draw the third picture in a different style. My days were spent largely researching and writing about my knights at home, and sketching and coloring the pictures, sometimes at home and sometimes in the art room at school. I generally met with my off-campus advisor, the medieval history professor at B.C, once a week, either by phone or in person, depending on her schedule’s flexibility. After I completed a biography, I would send it to her, and she would make edits and suggestions.</p>','<p>I think that the hardest part of project was the high level of self-discipline it required. My mom and dad both work during the week, so I was almost always home alone for the majority of the day, and almost the entirety of the work part of my day. As a result, I was the only person keeping myself on task, and ensuring that I produced an acceptable final product. When the majority of my work requires me to be on a computer, the avenues of procrastination and distraction can be seemingly endless. Fortunately I was able to keep control and ended up with a pleasing result.</p><p>The product, although challenging at times, was very rewarding. Never before had I been able to spend such a long time working in my favorite area of study, medieval history. Furthermore, it was a really unique and wonderful experience for me to meet and discuss history with a real medieval history professor. The ability to speak to someone who knew so much about my favorite time period and could direct me to the right books that I should read and give me advice with my writing was invaluable, and a truly great experience. A career as a medieval history professor is definitely a path I have seriously considered pursuing, and to meet someone who has been so successful in that field was very informative. The most rewarding aspect of the project was definitely the creation of a final product that I will have for the rest of my life. I found the final result of the drawings especially rewarding, as I was surprised by how well they came out. I had generally assumed that all the artistic genes in the family had gone to Eamon and perhaps to Joseph, and had only decided to try and draw the pictures in order that the final product might give a better representation of what I would want the actual book to look like. However, after seeing how well the pictures came out, I might have to admit that perhaps I did receive some of the artistic genes.</p><p>I learned a lot more about myself from this project than that I had a passable level of artistic ability. Never before in my academic career had I written any papers near the length of these biographies. Moving onto college next year, I understand that I have a lot of very lengthy papers in my future, and my experience during this project will make the first few seem less daunting as I now understand that I am quite capable of producing longer academic papers. Also as I mentioned before, I spent a large amount of the project home alone, and spent most evenings at publication meetings or Musical rehearsals. As a result, I saw much less of my family than usual; giving me another taste of what life will be like next year.</p><p>Honestly, the project could not have been much more rewarding. There are only a few suggestions I would make to someone else trying a similar project. First of all I would advise the individual to gather their various sources (books mostly) before the project. I was unable, in part because I did not have time, to get access to a few primary sources which I would have liked to have referenced for some of biographies, and at times I had to wait for books to arrive at my local library before I could continue writing. Another possible suggestion would be to split the project in two, having one person do the drawing, and the other the writing portion. I got a glimpse of that from having my brother do one of the drawings and I think the experience would have been interesting. This method would allow for an individual to focus more intently on their element of the book and ultimately produce a lengthier and more polished final product. However, such a split is not 100% necessary and I really enjoyed doing most of the artwork myself. I had not had a chance to work with Mr. Buckley since freshman year, and it was a lot of fun to do some artwork with him again. There are few things in my life that evoke more pride, than looking at a piece of my own artwork that I find impressive.</p><p>I would highly recommend this project to another student under the right circumstances. I would warn a prospective student that he would have to be honestly interested in the subject or topic of his coffee table book, and that he would have to be prepared to exercise some serious self-discipline. Keeping on task when you are home alone can be difficult, but it is much easier if you enjoy the work you are doing. If you fulfill those two prerequisites, I would highly recommend this project because I think it serves as a great learning experience, especially for a high-school senior preparing for college.</p>');

Given my history with the school and my previous experience working with kids (at a daycare and summer camp a few summers ago, among other experiences), it seemed like a logical and interesting choice. My day-to-day responsiblities were fairly flexible, which I enjoyed. In general, I assisted teachers whenever they needed help, and although I had a few classes in which I helped out regularly, my work days were nicely varied. There were a few classes that I worked with fairly consistently: the 7th grade drama class, for example, for their production of two 1-act murder mysteries, one of the 5th grade classes, as they edited and “published” original short stories, and a 3rd/4th grade science class as they constructed balsa wood catapults, a project I remembered fondly from eight years ago. In the last week of the ISP, I was also asked to help out in a second grade class for much of the week, whose teacher was in need of some assitance after having surgery on his leg. I also wound up working with the 7th and 8th grade history classes, whose teacher I knew from my own 8th grade year, where I taught a lesson on the Battle of Gettysburg, assisted in other Civil War lessons and activities, and gave a reading of a monologue I wrote in 8th grade for a class that was embarking on the same project. In my free time, I did some work scanning old archived photos for CFS’s upcoming 50th anniversary, but as my ISP went on I found that I had less time to help in that area than I first anticipated.</p>','<p>One of the best aspects of this project was the fact that I attended CFS for eight years, and know it well. Many of the classes, lessons and projects on which I helped students and teachers I remember from my own middle school years, and I also know many of the teachers and staff from back then as well. As I’ve discovered in past experiences, it was also rewarding and enjoyable to work with kids, especially those in the lower grades. Being appreciated and welcomed into their classes was a great feeling, and I got to know a lot of the kids in the classes I worked in pretty well by the end of my ISP. I especially liked discovering kids’ interests and passions that aligned with my own, so I could connect with them on a level beyond “teacher-student”: one 2nd grader loved rock climbing, another 5th grader was a huge Green Day fan, several 7th graders were similarly passionate about history, an 8th grader played Macbeth in their winter theater production, etc. My day-to-day experiences were, in general, very satisfying. Having a flexible schedule meant that I wasn’t doing the same kinds of things day in and day out, and I wound up helping out in several different classes, and enjoyed each one. Especially rewarding were the times I did some hands-on teaching in the middle school history classes, such as teaching the 7th grade about the Battle of Gettysburg; were I to do this project again, I’d try to figure out a way to do more of that. The only part of this project about which I’m not highly enthusiastic was the archiving, as it could get fairly tedious; however, it didn’t occupy a very large portion of my time, and I was sustained by the knowledge that it was a necessary and helpful task.</p><p>To any future members of Class I embarking on a similar ISP, I would offer the following advice. First, it certainly helps to know the school and faculty beforehand, as you’ll already be comfortable with the place and probably better able to focus on areas in which you’re particularly interested. In that same vein, I’d also recommend that, as much as possible, anybody doing a school-related ISP should take initiative. Set up the project specifically so that you’ll be doing things you like, so your interest will be maintained and you can avert boredom. Finally, have fun with it. This project was tremendously enjoyable for me, and I’d recommend it to just about anybody, but you’ve got to be ready and willing to make the most of it. My own goal throughout these five weeks was to be as helpful as possible with a maximum amount of fun, and I think that’s a pretty good guideline for anyone seeking to do this kind of ISP.</p>');

During the first few weeks of my ISP, I attempted to differentiate different cell types from mouse embryonic stem cells. These cells included cardiomyocytes, placental cells, and neuronal cells. The placental differentiation was successful after a few days; both the cardiomyocyte and the neuronal differentiation protocols were far more difficult. Although I did obtain neuronal precursor cells, the neuronal differentiation went awry on several occasions, and in the third assay the cells were infected by yeast. The cardiomyocyte assay, although some plates were infected by yeast, turned out successfully, as we observed beating on the plates. In addition, the final week and a half of the project, I assisted Warren in his Ph.D. to observe methylation/acetylation in ES cells; i.e. to see why some genes are turned off or turned on is ES/differentiated cells.</p>','<p>The reward of my project was in many ways, analogous to the challenges. Science is hard, and good science is extremely difficult. Although during several different assays we did not entirely succeed in differentiating cell types of performing gene expression, often times we tried again until we did observe success. Learning from the trials and tribulations made the process incredibly rewarding, and exposed me to a more real side of science that to most RL kids goes unnoticed.</p><p>Having one through my ISP, I learned that science is something which I truly want to pursue. Although the commute was arduous and lengthy to get into Kendall Square, the project made the effort all worthwhile. Engaging in scientific pursuits is an exciting and collaborative effort which brings people from different backgrounds together. It is in this type of working environment where I see myself working in the coming years.</p><p>To make the project more rewarding, I wish that I had simply had more time. Many experiments went awry, and simply due to time constraints I was not able to perform them fully to the best of my ability. Other protocols simply called for lengthy durations of time to complete, time which we did not have. Frankly, I felt that the 4th quarter at RL was rushed to complete the work of a full quarter and not a typical RL learning experience.

The Glen-L is a 10 foot, wood and fiberglass outboard motorboat. Joe and I obtained plans from Glen-L, a company that sells plans for home boat making projects. For the first two weeks of our project we built a sort of rough draft out of scrap plywood Joe had around his house. In these initial days we learned how to cut, screw, nail, plane, sand, glue and bend wood, skills which we subsequently used in building our higher quality final draft. When we had completed a scrap-wood skeleton we then moved on to the final product which we then spent the next three weeks constructing. The final draft, when completed, will consist of a mahogany frame covered in marine plywood and a coating of fiberglass. A normal day at work consisted of an early morning meeting with our advisor, Antin, followed by a few hours at our various boat building tasks. We would meet again around 12, usually over lunch, and discuss our progress and make plans for the afternoon.</p>','<p>The most rewarding aspect of this project was undoubtedly watching as our boat took shape. Looking at pictures of completed squirts online at the start of our project I was doubtful we could build something so elegant. Watching our boat slowly take shape and seeing the progress we have made over the last few weeks has therefore been thoroughly enjoyable. Learning the basic skills necessary to build a boat was especially challenging for me. I had little knowledge of carpentry before this project and had to learn on the job. For this reason the initial frame we made with scrap wood was incredibly helpful for me. Practicing the process gave me the confidence to construct the second iteration of our boat.</p><p>Obviously, I would have preferred to finish the boat but even more important than the finished product was the experience and the skills I learned along the way. I would highly recommend boat building as an ISP. Besides boat building being incredibly fun, the wood-working and construction skills I learned over the course of the project are invaluable and will be with me for life.</p>');

As a start, I research various methods for building a boat at home and found the website for Glen-L boat designs. On the Glen-L website I decided I would like to build the “Squirt”, a ten foot, motor powered, mahogany runabout. The boat would be built by constructing a frame out of mahogany, covering the frame with marine grade plywood, and then applying a coat of fiberglass to protect the wood. I researched this method with books from the local library as well as through the very helpful online forum on the Glen-L website. After acquiring a set of full sized plans for “Squirt” we began work on a mock boat that we constructed out of scrap lumber and plywood. This method allowed us to essentially create the entire frame once on scrap wood which was much more forgiving than the harder, and more expensive, mahogany. We learned how to transfer the plans onto the wood, to cut with appropriate precision, to sand even to more precise measures, to bend wood, and how to glue properly. After honing our skills we moved on to the mahogany that would be used to make the frames on the actual boat. Doing the process a second time went much more smoothly and prevented some mistakes that would have held us up. As the boat stands now it is ready for plywood planking to be applied to the bottom. This plywood will then be covered in a layer of fiberglass and painted. Then the deck planking will be applied and fiber glassed. After that the seating will go in, then the motor and steering wheel. We plan to continue working and hope to have it in use by the middle of the summer.</p>','<p>Our days would start at around 8:00 or 8:30 when Dante and I would meet with our adviser to make a plan for the day and share any research we found the night before. Then we would set out on our various projects for the day until we met up with our adviser again around lunch to regroup and plan the afternoon. Work would then continue until one of us had to leave for a sporting event. Quite often we would meet up again after practice for a little while. Boatbuilding requires a lot of gluing with epoxy so putting in an hour of work in the evening as I did almost every night can be a great help because you are able to let the epoxy dry overnight. Also, I really enjoyed the work so I would spend as much free time in the workshop as I could. The evenings were also a time for us to research certain methods we would be using in the coming days, a task our adviser would give us quite often so that we were prepared when the time came to make a specific cut or other act. We found the online forums invaluable because they provided us access to countless people who had made the exact same boat as us and thus knew our confusions from first hand experience.</p><p>The most challenging part of this project was learning the appropriate skills. Although I had some woodworking experience I soon learned that boatbuilding requires a certain amount of precision that I had never experienced. Even the slightest mistake in a frame can change the entire shape of the boat. However, our adviser did a great job teaching us how to use the tools effectively and safely. Also, his idea of building a scrap boat gave us great confidence in our abilities so that when the time came to start the real boat we were better carpenters and far more confident in our work.</p><p>I really value the experience I gained in this project because I was able to learn valuable carpentry skills as well as a lot about the way a boat is built. I also learned how to be patient when working with wood, the importance of precision, and how, although power tools are effective, sometimes there is no substitute for hard work and elbow grease. I also love the idea of being able to ride in a boat that I built myself and keeping the boat for my entire life.</p><p>I would recommend the project for anyone interest in woodworking or boats. It is very tough work and will definitely test your patience but I feel the reward is worth it. If anyone considers building a boat as their project I would love for them to contact me.</p><p>I want to thank Mr. Thornton for helping to make this project possible, Mrs. White for being our on campus adviser, and Antin Giandomenico for being our off campus adviser.</p>');

Tucker, like all Milton Public Schools, sports a large French immersion program, which I myself went through, so while there I worked with two of my former teachers, Mme. Horowitz and Ms. Sewall. My job varied depending on the class with which I worked (Sewall for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Horowitz for the other days). In Mme. Horowitz’s class, a group of twenty-five 2nd graders learning all their lessons in French, it was best for me to work with a small group of students who were struggling to learn as fast as the rest of the class. In this way, I could parallel Mme. Horowitz’ lesson with my students and ensure that they got as much attention as they needed in order for them to fully understand it. On these days, I would be speaking French probably ninety percent of the time. Ms. Sewall, on the other hand, worked a complex schedule of teaching French Language Arts to the 5th grade in addition to handling an all-around 4th grade class. Both these classes contained fewer numbers than that of Mme. Horowitz, often worked in groups on large projects, and spoke French only half the time, so my main task was to keep each group on track using whatever language worked. Apart from that, I essentially did whatever my teachers needed me to do, everything from running off copies (which I unfortunately mentioned had been a main activity of an ISP that had once been presented to me) to creating or grading worksheets.</p>','<p>By undertaking this project, I enjoyed reliving the past while witnessing the upbringing of a new generation, learned better how to deal with kids, improved my practical French-speaking skills, and, last but not least, spent a whole month being hero-worshipped by a bunch of 7-11 year olds. This was not an easy task, however. I found myself in a position of incredible responsibility (that of caring for a large group children) for seven hours a day, and I had to help them understand their lessons while using predominantly French. In so doing I became more aware of how I generally handle children, usually enduring any mischievousness patiently so long as I could successfully walk my charges through how to figure out their work by themselves (although I do not expect that patient demeanor will last at this rate!). On a different note, I found that I rarely had the chance to remain with the students during their extracurricular courses, like gym and art, and I believe that the project would have been much more rewarding had I done so. I would have had a much greater understanding of each of my students if I had seen them at recess, for example, outside the heavily supervised classroom setting. On the whole, I had a great time carrying out my Senior Project, and I would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy the same rewards that I experienced. I would especially not recommend it to a future senior who will want a loosely scheduled project, however, as some are; I knew exactly when and where I would be throughout the whole project, and had to conform to yet another school timeline. But for someone undeterred by this quality of the project, I am sure an Independent Senior Project similar to my own would be an incredible experience. It was certainly incredible for me.</p>');

On clinic days, I would come into the office at 7:30. I would stay through the morning section, which was normally 21-24 patients starting at 8:00 and ending around 12:30-12:45. I would follow Dr. Theodore into the rooms to see patients. The average visit would consist of a physical exam, review of images (X ray, MRI), diagnosis of the problem, and a plan for a course of action. Surgeries were conducted in two places, the Wang Ambulatory Center in Boston and Mass General West in Waltham. In either case, for surgeries I would show up at 7:30 and the first procedure would normally start at 8:00. I observed many different surgeries, from bunionectomies, to insertion of plates to fix fractures, to tendon repairs, to arthroscopies, and much more. Being a high school student, I wasn’t allowed to touch or participate at all in the surgery – or in the clinic – but just observing everything was still quite interesting.</p>','<p>This project was interesting for a number of reasons. First, the work that Dr. Theodore was doing was simply cool. The human body is amazing, and being able to diagnose a problem, then go in and fix it is fascinating to me. While the work itself was interesting, the people I was working with were also great. Dr. Theodore is a great doctor, but he also has quite a gregarious personality. So he was always cracking jokes in the operating room or in the hallway. Being around him was always fun. Also, I spent a lot of time with his medical assistant Briana. Briana was fun to be around with her thick Boston accent and boundless positive energy. These two people were always great to be around, but they also helped me understand the technical side of the work too, so that I could appreciate it on a deeper level.</p><p>I originally chose this ISP because I had been considering pursuing medicine as a possible career choice. This project definitely educated me on that choice. I learned that being a doctor is a really tough job. There are long hours with relentless work in between. Every procedure you do means a lot to the patient, so there is a constant pressure to perform at the highest level. Also, there are many changes happening in the medicine, with health-care and other budgetary moves that are shifting the landscape of the industry. As a result, Dr. Theodore was cautious in advising me to become a doctor. However, despite these cons, the pros far outweigh them. Dr. Theodore always said that it was such a privilege to be able to help people in such an important and personal way. So ultimately, this project has sharpened my focus on medicine.</p><p>The one drawback of the project is that I wasn’t able to actually do that much, being a high school student. While this is not surprising, it would have been nice to perhaps have had a bit more of an active role. Still though, I thought this was a terrific project for anyone interested in medicine, and I would whole heartedly recommend it.</p>');

I helped “implement the program”, in any way I was needed, from cleaning up the weight room to running a few soccer players through a sprint workout. I worked 7am to 2pm, 4 days a week. I commuted to Harvard, via the Commuter Rail and Red Line. I was responsible for reading several books (Science and Practice of Strength Training, The Fred Factor, The Energy Bus, 5 Dysfunctions of a Team, and Eat that Frog), and passing in summaries of each. I also viewed three DVD’s (Iowa Strength & Conditioning, Developing Explosive Power, and Functional Flexibility), writing summaries for these as well. I performed my own workouts every day, and eventually tried my own hand in writing workout programs for myself and the Women’s Volleyball team. On my final day, I was tested by Coach Frazier on the core principles of Harvard’s Strength & Conditioning program. Finally, after the ISP presentations on June 1st, I ran a session in the RL weight room, to teach the Squat, using the progression and instructions from Harvard’s program.</p>','<p>This project was incredibly rewarding. I learned much about strength and conditioning, and also the career of a strength coach. Although I had previous education on the subject of strength training, I learned the Olympic movements for the first time. These lifts require focused attention to technique, while developing explosive, full-body power. I was able to engage in conversation with the coaching staff every day, asking any questions that came to mind, from long term programming to supplements. Coaches Frazier, Schumacher, Mullen, and West are immensely knowledgable and experienced, and I was thrilled to have engaged them on a daily basis. I thoroughly enjoyed writing my own workout programs, and then receiving constructive criticism and suggestions from the coaching staff.</p><p>Th only potential drawback of my ISP was the fact that my five weeks fell during Harvard’s exam/reading period, meaning that the weight room had reduced hours, and was not nearly as busy as normally. Although I may not have seen the weight room filled to the brim with athletes and bustling with efficiency, I had more access to the coaching staff because of this downtime. I do not see the exam period as a drawback, since I learned so much from my conversations with the strength coaches, who would not have had nearly as much time to chat with me during a normal semester.</p><p>I would highly recommend this project to future seniors. If a student enjoys the workouts at RL with Walter and the IPF trainers, this would be a perfect ISP. A student can learn the “how and why” of strength training, in order to fully understand all the workouts that Walter runs. However, the commute was substantial (average of 1 hr 15 mins each way), which may deter some students.</p>');

Also, in more general terms, it was rewarding since I was able to help out MFH as they were in the process of designing a new website. The only thing that could have potentially made this project more rewarding would be if it were longer than five weeks so I could possibly travel and do some hands on work for some of their projects. </p><p>The most challenging aspect of this project was project description assignment for the new website. Since MFH currently runs 17 projects in 9 different countries worldwide, it took quite some time to do an adequate amount of research both on my own and with MFH’s assistance (with the quarterly reports). As a whole though, the work was never over burdening but simply a lot at times. </p><p>In conclusion, I’ve learned a great deal about myself and more importantly about what I may in fact want to do with my life. After coming to grips with the problems the world around us suffers from, especially in the lesser developed countries,  I’ve gained more and more interest in helping those that suffer because a vast majority shouldn’t have to feel that pain. Now, I’m almost positive that I want to pursue a major in something along the lines of international relations when I attend college.

As I arrived the other members of the kitchen staff came at about the same time and we would all head into the restaurant together to begin our day. First I would go down to the basement and get dressed, my daily wardrobe consisted of a chef coat and chef pants with croc style shoes for easy gripping around the slippery kitchen. Once I was dressed I would go into the huge walk in refrigerator and bring up the huge pots of sauce and chicken stock to the kitchen so they could be heated for lunch. I would then evaluate the kitchen supplies and record what we were low on and needed more of and what we were all set on. After that I would go back down stairs and prepare everything that we needed for that day. Normally the daily preparations consisted of cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, cheese and simple things like that. Once all the simpler preparations were done and brought up stairs to the kitchen line I would go back downstairs to help the kitchen staff do all the weekly preparations that were generally a bit more detailed. The weekly preparations that I was involved in ranged from making filling for ravioli to preparing the hundreds of gallons of red sauce needed each week, to cutting huge bags of beats for salads and cutting loafs of bread into croutons for salad.</p><p>By 11:30 the restaurant opened for its daily lunch service. In the early stages of my ISP I spent most of this time trying to stay out of the way, absorb as much as I could and help out where I could running downstairs to get ingredients as they were needed in the kitchen. I eventually mastered all the salads on the menu and was responsible for making those. However for the last few weeks I was a fully functioning member of the kitchen staff and was able to cook on the line with the chefs and hold my own with even the most extravagant of lunch orders. Once the lunch service was over around 2:30 I helped clean everything up and bring the lunch specific items back downstairs to make room for the dinner items. Around 2:30 the dinner staff would come in and all the restaurant employees would enjoy a huge lunch in the dining area, unfortunately I never really was able to enjoy the lunch because I had to get to school for practice.</p>','<p>The most rewarding part of the project was really getting the opportunity to bring my culinary passion to life. I was able to learn a lot about how a kitchen should operate and techniques that can enhance my cooking. I enjoyed meeting the people that worked at the restaurant and hearing their personal stories about how they ended up at Sweet Basil. For example there were three brothers from Brazil that came to the U.S. for the opportunities it presented. They all started out working in restaurants as dish washers and now all three of them are top chefs that were able to teach me a great deal about cooking.</p><p>The most challenging part of my project was the learning curve that I had to overcome to feel comfortable in a new kitchen. Thankfully I had a pretty good base knowledge of cooking going into the project so I was able to rely on that but it was hard to learn where everything was and the intricacies of a foreign kitchen.</p><p>I learned a great deal about myself as a result of this project, perhaps most notably I was able to get a gage for how large my culinary knowledge truly was, realizing that I still have a lot to learn. It was also a great experience in learning how to run a successful business. I was able to observe all the different pieces of the machine that kept the restaurant going and how they fit together to create a tasty product.</p><p>The project may have been more rewarding for me if I was able to work with the chefs on more of a one on one basis. It was just too busy in the restaurant with too much going on for there to be any direct teaching. On the other hand it was a great experience to learn as I went and a more true to life model of jumping into a business. I was able to pick things up and observe the professionals doing what they do best.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this project to people with a true culinary passion. This project is not for people trying to get out of work by cooking. It was hard work with demanding expectations. I was directly responsible for people’s lively hoods and they counted on me to not screw that up so it required me to take it seriously. With that being said I learned a lot and was inspired from the people I met and the food they cooked.</p>');

I was held accountable for arriving on time, completing tasks to the best of my ability and sending materials quickly. As for the sports agency part, I saw how the web of connections played a major role. Agents must constantly be in discussion with coaches of teams of all professional (and college) levels, looking for marketing opportunities and watching over the player’s emotions. A parent has a biased opinion regarding their child’s performance. Though they are an integral part of maintaining the player’s confidence, it is the agents job to maintain a realistic view of teams that the player could make. Patrick told me on the first day that connections are the most important part of the business. Sometimes you have to go out of your way to help someone that won’t directly aid you. However, you do it because in the future, when you need a favor, they will be there to help. Without connections you can’t get anything done in the sports agency business.</p><p>Sports agents have a reputation of being cold, gutless, greedy and manipulative. At least this is what is produced on television. However, especially in the MLS market, with so little (relative) money circulating for contracts and endorsements, agents must be flexible, understanding and forgiving.</p><p>Though the experience was enjoyable and rewarding, there were difficult aspects. Some of the daily tasks were somewhat boring, but that is to be expected with every business. Sometimes in order to complete a task, I had to read up on rules (i.e. MLS collective bargaining agreement). Since the company had been operating effectively long before I arrived, I didn’t want to mess up the dynamic of the small group while still making my mark on the company. Things that were natural to Patrick took explaining over (and over) to me. However, with all that in mind, Patrick walked me through it every step of the way, not only making sure that I completed tasks appropriately but also that I understood what I was doing and why it needed to be done.</p><p>Since this is only a six week stretch, this ISP is not limited to future sports agents. If you have a passion for soccer I would highly recommend this project. It is interesting to see what happens off the pitch. In addition, you spend the day discussing domestic and international players and games, watching highlight reels and occasionally meeting with MLS players.</p>');

BTA is a private Christian school in Hyde Park, Massachusetts with a student body of fewer than 250 students. The headmaster, Frank Guerra, formerly taught Bible Study at Roxbury Latin, and students from RL often go there to tutor the students there. My primary task there was twofold. First, I was to tutor students struggling in a variety of subjects including, but not limited to, Math, Physics, US History, French, and English. My second job was to teach a few classes per week or to proctor some test or quiz sections. When I was not doing those jobs, I was tasked with grading homework, quizzes, and tests unless a teacher needed an aide for a lab or to help with some odd job. Twice I was called upon as an extra chaperone for a field trip. My official title was “Teacher’s Helper,” meaning I was essentially a resource that the teachers could take advantage of as necessary.</p>','<p>While working at a school seems like a fairly mundane Project, I completely underestimated the extent to which this would be a rewarding experience. As an introverted person, I did not expect that I would be capable of being a useful asset to BTA, and worried that the next 35 days would consist of my not being authoritative enough to be a teacher’s aide. I didn’t know how the children would take to me, having never taught and unsure of how I would fare as a middle-school teacher, remembering my own rather rowdy days in 8th grade. Much to my surprise, not only did the students seem to rather enjoy my teaching them, I honestly believe that their academic performance increased, even if only a little. In addition, I became good friends with some the seniors studying there, as well as some of the younger students.</p><p>During my first week at BTA I was a bit displaced, unaware of when I was supposed to go where, and not acquainted with any of the faculty enough for me to be of use to them. However, as I made my presence known in the building, I found myself being contracted for more and more work and for increasingly larger projects, being placed on a Judges Board for a US History project, for example. Looking back on the experience, I feel that the feelings of resentment at the fact that my previous ISP had been rejected have been mollified to some extent. I also feel as though I came away from this experience with the understanding of a teacher’s point of view in a classroom environment. Ultimately, I would recommend this ISP to anyone that wants to work in a fast-paced environment where he would be required to work with many individuals both one on one and as a group.</p>');

My goal was to improve my creative writing skills and also to try different types of writing that I hadn’t previously had experience with. My off-campus advisor was John Wihbey, a former Roxbury Latin teacher and a researcher at Harvard Kennedy School. I ended up completing two pieces, a lengthy fictional short story and a shorter nonfiction piece. The fiction short story took a majority of the project and was on the longer end in terms of short stories. The story involves a man named Lyons Kelly who becomes the first human to travel to Mars. Unexpectedly, his spaceship malfunctions when he gets there, and the only way to save him is to freeze his body and put it into suspended animation. Eventually, he wakes up on Earth, only it is 50 years later and Lyons runs into difficulty adjusting to the new Earth. The second nonfiction piece was over a week and is much shorter in length. It is based on a trip to the Museum of Science that I took, and is a recollection of my experiences there. My daily work included planning, thinking, and writing my stories.</p>','<p>The project’s rewards came from the ability to have a month of unstructured time to think only about writing. Often when I would think about writing throughout the school year, I would get started on an idea, and then have to abandon it or put it on hold because of school work and various activities that occupied me. Such discontinuity made it hard to commit to a story and to give it as much attention as I wanted to. This ISP allowed me to develop as a writer because I was finally able to start a story, work at it continuously and thoroughly, and then complete it in a satisfying way. It was very rewarding to have a complete story in front of me as the product of all my work.</p><p>Creative writing turned out to be more challenging than I expected. First of all, it’s extremely hard to focus for more than a few hours straight on writing. I happen to be a rather meticulous, slow writer, and so if I don’t take a number of breaks in between blocks of writing, then I tend not to be able to focus as well and my writing turns stale. Also, it’s a very solitary project and tends to be somewhat monotonous. I don’t have a laptop, so I was unable to move around to different places. When trying to do creative writing, factors in your location do matter—indoors vs. outdoors, at home vs. out of the house, what kind of view you have. But I only had a desktop computer that was rooted to the same place on the same table in front of the same maple tree. Another challenge was keeping myself motivated and positive about my story. There were a lot of times when I felt as if my story wasn’t going anywhere and that I did not want to finish it. Luckily as I forced myself to press on, it turned out much better than expected.</p><p>One important thing that I learned about myself is that I do enjoy writing more than I thought I would. I think that the solitude and the monotony are a little too overwhelming to write for a living, but perhaps my situation is not reflective of all writing experiences. I learned that I can write decently, and the problem for me is coming up with the ideas that propel a story forward. Nevertheless, this ISP has made me want to continue to write as a hobby in future years at the very least.</p><p>I would recommend this project only if the participant knows that he is passionate enough about writing to sit down and write for 5 hours a day without going crazy. Some people are perfectly capable of focusing themselves completely on a story and so perhaps the monotony isn’t as much of a problem. I would recommend doing this project as long as you have other activities going on as well that are more social and active. For example, I had tennis practice and musical rehearsal every day after my ISP, so I could put my writing aside for a while and go run around or socialize. I feel like if I didn’t have these set activities every day, I would have been much less refreshed and ready to write the following day. So my recommendation is write if you’re passionate about it, but make sure it’s not just writing that’s filling up your life for the whole month.</p>');

With only five weeks to build, we knew we would have to choose a simple design so that we could finish in time. We settled on plans for a simple 10½-foot skiff from the internet (url below). The construction was based on a technique called stitch and glue, where we join flat pieces of plywood along their edges – by screws, zip ties, or whatever comes to hand – then glue them together with epoxy resin (a good source is Jamestown Distributors, we used the West System epoxy, url below). Next, we reinforced the seams where pieces meet with fiberglass tape (also from Jamestown Distributors), both to seal and strengthen them. We started at the prow, joining the two sides. Then, as we bent the sides towards each other, we added ribs between them to maintain the correct spacing. We attached a transom between the two sides, cut out the flat bottom, and attached it. We spent the last week painting our boat red and white. It floated.</p><p>Skiff plans:</p><p>http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/skiff/skiff.htm</p><p>Jamestown Distributors:</p><p>http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/main.do</p>','<p>It was especially rewarding to sit in the boat and marvel at the lack of leaks. Not only had we produced a tangible result for our project, but we had also made something seaworthy. I expect having the boat will continue to be rewarding this summer as Garrett and I continue boating. However, this project was not without its problems. Garrett and I often failed to plan very far in advance, and our relative lack of woodworking experience left us stumped at times. We wasted entire days on some steps, and that became frustrating – good planning is essential and would have made the project run more smoothly and be a bit more rewarding.</p><p>I would certainly recommend this sort of project to a younger boy: you end up with a boat just in time for the summer, you spend a lot of time with a close friend, you make your own hours, and it’s surprisingly inexpensive (if you have some tools already and take advantage of the RL scene shop.)</p>');

This ISP allowed us to do equal work in both in order to answer the ultimate question, “How does basketball change from place to place in Boston?” However, the most rewarding aspect was one that we did not think would be the focus of this ISP: the interaction with the diverse personalities and the sharing of experiences among us. We all come from different backgrounds but the love of basketball brings us all together—we found the famous phrase “Basketball is a Brotherhood” to ring true.</p><p>Going towards the first court, we both believed that revealing the presence of the camera would be the most challenging part. However, we soon came to the realization that almost everyone was comfortable enough to open up in front of the lens. Choosing the right camera angles and finding the correct lighting were the hardest parts since neither of us had much experience with a camera.</p><p>The initial goal of the project was to discover the relationship between Boston and basketball but during the past five weeks we have learned more about ourselves than any aspect of the project. We have come to love basketball even more than we did before, appreciate (and suffer) the amount of time and effort that the making a movie demands, and most importantly, we enjoyed the experience of interacting with a broad range of unique characters. It is quite possible that next year we will both double major in sociology and film-making while playing basketball in our spare time!</p><p>As it is often the case with many ISPs, more time would have been helpful to make this experience more rewarding. We had five weeks for this project, enough to fully complete no more than five courts. Although we feel that each one of them is distinct in its own way, we would have liked to visit more courts in Boston to discover the full spectrum. If time permitted, it would have also been interesting to visit other cities such as NYC to compare the personalities of its courts to the ones in Boston—i.e., do our project on an even grander scale (the stuff of dreams!).</p><p>We would most definitely recommend this project. Of course, the subject matter would not appeal to everyone—just to those who are fond of basketball and filmmaking. We are neither the first nor the last to make a film about basketball, but we believe that our passion for both fields (basketball and film) have acted as the catalysts for our dedication to complete an artistic depiction of how the game of basketball lives in Boston.</p>');

The basic plot of the mockumentary was that a camera crew had decided to follow around a college basketball team as they prepared for their big championship game against their rivals. The players on the team, however, all turn out to be really bad at basketball and are ridiculous individuals. We used a Sony HD camera to do all of the filming for the project. To edit, we used the basic Imovie 11 app that can be downloaded on Macs. For the actors in our mockumentary, we enlisted 6 members from the RL class of 2011, and two seniors from Winsor. To accomplish our project, we broke the first five weeks into parts. For the first week, we worked on writing our script for the short film, and prepared for filming. Then once a week, we would hold filming with as many of the group as possible, and edit the footage collected at these filmings until the next filming date at which point we would create a new mass of footage to work with. Given this, day to day, a large majority of our time was spent editing the raw footage we had collected.</p>','<p>What I found most rewarding about my project was the freedom it gave me to be both creative and independent. Given the nature of our project, it ended up being quite different from any other kind of work I had done in my 6 years at RL. Other than our weekly meetings with Mr. Silver (our off-campus advisor) and Mr. Piper (our on-campus advisor), Connor and I were responsible for our own time usage. This level of independence and self-governance was entirely new, and something that I ended up enjoying quite a bit. The creative nature was also something new and different. Many times at RL, we fall into a monotony of how school goes. There are times when school life becomes very cut and dry rote memorization. Getting an opportunity to exercise our creativity was something entirely new, and Connor and I both enjoyed this opportunity immensely.</p><p>The thing we found most challenging about our project was the logistics of working around the 8 different schedules of the actors involved. Given the subject matter of the film (a team), we really couldn’t do work except for days when at least a majority of the characters were free and willing to give us their time. Trying to get 8 people to agree on times was frustratingly difficult. The other issue with working with 8 peers is that sometimes efficiency was lost due to people’s inability to remain focused when doing something relatively fun with their friends. It sometimes got frustrating to stop people from shooting basketballs when we were describing a scene, or to get people to stop talking so that we could get a shot. Working with 8 friends in short, made things a bit frustrating at times.</p><p>I learned through my Senior Project that if given the opportunity I really do have the discipline to police my own time and get done what needs to be finished. Connor and I found that we, in fact, truly got all of our work done on schedule, and many times, ahead of schedule. We were quite successful in policing ourselves, and keeping the other on task should one of us falter. Our project wouldn’t have worked without this ability on our parts, and it was nice to learn that we possessed it.</p><p>The only thing that I can think of that would make our project more rewarding to me personally would be a more extended period of time to continue to make the film longer and more in depth. I really think we only scratched the surface of what is possible with our mockumentary, and more time to work on it would have improved its quality.</p><p>I would recommend this project to future RL seniors given the right conditions. Given its free and independent nature, it would be quite easy for a student running such a project to fall behind and get overwhelmed. Additionally, if one is unorganized or not talented at organizing, the project truly cannot function. Working around the moving parts of so many different schedules is difficult, and if you cannot make it work, you will not end up with a finished project at the end of the day. However, if a student can remain on focus, and get his actors to filming with consistency, then I would definitely recommend the project as I found it so rewarding. The level of independence it provided me was a breath of fresh air after 6 years of RL’s curriculum, and I both enjoyed it immensely, and learned a great deal about filming and editing. It was a project that was both rewarding to me, and quite fun for Connor and me.</p>');

However, despite both being hospitals, my experience could not have more different at each. At Brockton, I shadowed an Anesthesia attending, Dr. Khaled Sorour, who is the chief of the Critical Care Unit (CCU), as well as the Tufts Medical Center residents working underneath him. On a daily basis, I would arrive in the morning for a lecture that Dr. Sorour would give to the residents. The topics would vary, but they were always on some aspect of patient care in the CCU, such as proper ventilation, or therapeutic hypothermia. After this I would round with Dr. Sorour and the residents for the rest of the day. This would involve visiting each patient’s room to check on their progress, and then meeting in the conference room for a more detailed treatment plan.</p>','<p>My experience at MGH focused on the procedural side of medicine, as opposed to clinical medicine. In the morning I would meet my nursing coordinator, Laurie Lynch, (who orients the incoming residents and medical students) who would have one or two surgeries that I would watch that day. During the surgery, I would assist the physicians by doing minor things that the surgeons and scrub nurses were unable to do because of the sterile surgical field, such as answering the OR phone, or adjusting their gowns.</p><p>I found this project rewarding in terms of the education I received. At Brockton, I was able to see the progress of the care of critically ill patients using the most cutting-edge of medical technologies. I was able to follow many from their admission into the CCU all the way to their discharge, or in some cases, even death. It was an interesting perspective of the capabilities, limits, and bureaucracy of modern medicine. At MGH, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to view extremely interesting procedures. Some of my favorites included an aortic and mitral valve replacement, an aortic dissection, and a brain aneurysm.</p><p>One of the greatest challenges of my project was how much of the medical world was beyond my comprehension. On a daily basis, I was surrounded by people who had a minimum of six years of higher education than I did, and most had many more years of highly specialized training. This was frustrating at times, but I found that I was able to help myself out by creating a list of terms I did not understand each day, and researching those terms so that I was far better prepared the following day.</p><p>From this project, my interest in pursuing a career in medicine, and eventually going to medical school was solidified. I was in awe of the knowledge, experience, and work ethic of all the individuals around me, and I know now for sure that I would love to be a part of the medical workforce in a much more involved way in the future. This experience taught me that I have the stamina and interest to pursue medical school, and also that it will be a lot of difficult work.</p><p>I think that this project was extremely rewarding, and there is very little that I would have changed about my experience. As I previously stated, it was difficult to assimilate into the medical culture because of my lack of experience, but ultimately, I do not think that there is anything I would have done to improve my experience.</p><p>I would definitely recommend my project to anyone who is interested in pursuing medical school. Either opportunity would give valuable insight to anyone who thinks that they might be interested in being a doctor. My mentors were very receptive to my situation, and while I was not babied, I certainly felt that I was able to keep up with what was going on around me most of the time.</p>');

The bulk of my project consisted of taking classes at The Eliot School in Jamaica Plain, named after John Eliot. There, I constructed a replica of an 18th century candle box under the guidance of Joe Stanewick, an instructor at The Eliot School and my off-campus advisor. Since I had virtually no prior woodworking experience, I spent a good amount of time learning basic information about wood and how to use it. Since I used several large pieces of machinery, such as a table saw, a jointer, and a planer, I also had to learn how to use them safely. The construction of a candle box is a typical entry-level woodworking project because it covers many aspects of woodworking, including milling, table saw use, measuring, carving, sanding, and drilling. However, we decided to take it a step further and give the wood a nice finish using dye, stain, and shellac. In the end, my box came out looking extremely nice due to the finish. Since I could not go to The Eliot School every day, I looked for other ways to expand my ISP. I went to the MFA to look at furniture and wooden pieces in the Art of the Americas wing, where I found several pieces from the same time period as the original candle boxes. I also went to the North Bennett Street School to observe a class, which was eye-opening. The NBSS is a professional level woodworking school, with classes that are up to 40 hours per week. Needless to say, the pieces on display were of a different caliber than what I had seen at The Eliot School, but it was great to see students using the same techniques I had learned.</p>','<p>My project was rewarding because it resulted in a physical product that I could take with me, which was one of my objectives in choosing an ISP.</p><p>The biggest challenge was the mental focus required at all times during my project.

I mostly worked in the Magistrate’s Session filling out dates for the DA. Attorneys would come in and figure out trial dates with the Magistrate. Other than that, I had the opportunity to observe real life trials. During my time, I followed 3 trials as frequently as I could: the Garrett Jackson murder trial, The Gorio Lopez murder trial, and the Michael Waterman Sexually Dangerous Person trial. I got a firsthand view of some the most important parts of our Criminal Justice system.</p>','<p>This project was rewarding in that I had the chance to meet some of Boston’s most important people in the criminal justice system including Magistrate Gary Wilson, Judge Carol Ball, and Judge Patrick Brady. I also had the chance to meet and talk with several defense and prosecution attorneys. They told me about their workload, lifestyle, and how they juggle all of their clients. The challenging part of the project was most definitely getting into and out of Government Center every day. The commute was an hour long each way and cost me $11 on one day alone.</p><p>This project has made me very intrigued about the field of Criminal Justice and it has added pursuing a law degree into my interests. My experience was very much interesting and entertaining and this sort of field has certainly now become one of my biggest attractions.</p><p>Having a longer ISP project period would have given me the opportunity to set up some more solid relationships with the people I worked for and with. Also, like I went over earlier, a shorter/cheaper commute would have been much more rewarding. Finally, my only hours in the courtroom were from 9:30am-1:00pm. I feel like I could have gotten more out of the experience if my hours in the courthouse were longer.</p><p>I would certainly suggest this project to anyone interested in becoming a lawyer. I had the chance to observe real life trials in all stages from opening statements through closing arguments and sentencing. I also had the chance to see the life of a lawyer in the workplace. It was interesting to see all of them juggle between all of their clients. I never really saw a lawyer who had one client to put all of his/her attention on. Overall, I just had the chance to observe some of the most important and interesting parts of the criminal justice system.</p>');

I undertook an internship at Mass General Hospital, where I was an official research assistant for Dr. Richard Ginsburg. I helped do research for a number of papers that he is planning on submitting to various journals in the near future. I worked at Mass General Hospital from 9AM to 3PM. Some days I worked in the resident’s computer lab, located in the Child Psychiatry Department in the Yawkey building. Here I would work amongst other interns who would be doing similar research. Other days I would work in an office with my supervisor, which was located in the Warren building. This was a quieter setting as there were only 2 people working I one room. If I had to really focus to get my work done, this was the place where I would go. On Mondays, I would meet with Dr. Ginsburg to discuss the work I did the past week as well as discuss how my athletic experiences matched up with the research I was reading. I would give him advice about how he could improve the paper as well as provide insight on major issues in the sports psychology world such as whether sport specialization at an early age is ultimately beneficial.</p><p>I also linked my internship up with Mike Singleton, who is the head of Mass Youth Soccer and the creator of the website Mind Measures. This website offers insight on the importance of the mental aspect of sports, as well as offering a test, which determines how mentally tough one is. My job was to help build up the website by finding research that backed up what the site was supporting. I also came up with a questionnaire of my own that I will be presenting to a wide array of sports teams this upcoming summer. Given that the Mind Measures offices were located in Lancaster Mass. and my job did not require me to work at the office building, I mostly worked at home. On Tuesdays I would meet with Mr. Singleton to discuss the work I did the past week. Like my meetings with Dr. Ginsburg I would give him advice on things that I thought could be improved as well as provide insight on the mental aspect of sports through my athletic experiences.</p>','<p>All in all, I really enjoyed my Independent School project.

This phrase is not of my own creation but instead is a popular saying around IPF and I bought into completely after my 5 week stint as intern. Walter Norton Jr. himself was often away on business so my off campus advisor in effect became Jamie Damon. My days at IPF were long and grueling, on the average day I would wake up at 3:55 AM and eat a proper breakfast as described by IPF. I would then drive to their facility in Andover. At which point I would join their 5:15 AM workout group. Jamie had me participate fully in the workouts until the last week; this is an important detail I will cover later. After their work out concluded at approximately 7:00 AM I would handle clerical duties in the office. Statistics are incredibly important and are used to show improvement in clients. The stats spanned: weight, body fat percents, 1.2 mile times, bike times, and new client cataloguing. This was all done via excel spread sheet. After all statistics where taken care of I would then perform maintenance. This task is overlooked and incredibly important. In a place where there is constant movement and sweating the only way IPF can be kept clean is through constant maintenance and cleaning of anything that comes in contact with humans. After the final cleaning tasks were completed Jamie and I would often talk about the science of proper training. My day would end at approximately 10:30 AM every day.</p>','<p>The reason for my participating in the workouts early on was for education. To be able to properly train others you must first be able to train yourself. The technique of your exercises must be flawless in order for you to demonstrate them to others. By the end of my 5 week stay at IPF I was demonstrating multiple exercises. I also took on full responsibility of setting up the equipment for the clients before they reach that block of the work out. This was essential as it made the workouts flow smoothly. It was rewarding to be able to notice that my presence had such an impact on the productiveness of the institute and I thoroughly enjoy contributing to a successful team effort. During this project I discovered how much I pride myself in a job well done, and despite being tired from a tough workout I would still strive to make the facilities spotless as I knew I was responsible for it. This project however was not without its challenges, it was incredibly taxing. My day consisted of wake up, 30 mile commute, IPF, 30 mile commute, grab what sleep I could at home, go to track, go home, eat and in bed by 8 if I was lucky. There was little time to socialize and relax. However it was worth it, I leave IPF with a wonderful knowledge of all that goes into making a facility like it run smoothly. I also learned much about the science of proper training which will be put on display during my presentation.</p><p>If you are an active person who likes to work out I would highly recommend this ISP, especially if you enjoy both blue and white collar work. But one parting note is that this ISP would have been much more enjoyable in the absence of a spring sport, as it both increases fatigue and saps time. This was an overall great opportunity and it turned into a terrific experience.</p>');

Everyday I was scheduled to fly for 2 hours, usually from 10 – 12. However, this was not always possible since I could not fly if the weather was not nice enough. When the weather was not ideal, I would usually have ground school and in the couple of rare cases where there was nothing for me to cover in ground school we merely canceled the lesson. When I was not flying or at ground school I would spend my time reading the required materials and reviewing what I had learned while flying. In the mornings I would usually spend about 2 hours making sure that I knew and looking over all the material I would need that day. After my lesson I would usually spend another 2 hours looking over what I had learned and preparing for the next lesson.</p>','<p>For me, the fact that I was actually developing and acquiring a new skill was the most rewarding part of the project. When I first began the project I had no experience with flying, but now at the end I feel very confident with the plane and would be capable of flying by myself. Also everyday was a new challenge. There were many different aspects of flying that I had to learn about and understand that I didn’t anticipate. Simple things such as navigation, accelerating, or even just cruising were far more complex and were affected by many more factors than I realized. While there are many other projects that would have necessitated developing skills, there aren’t many opportunities where I would have enough free time to learn how to fly.</p><p>The single greatest challenge of the project was learning to be aware of everything while I was flying. There was a huge number of factors that I had to be aware of while even doing something simple such as flying to another airport. When merely cruising I had to be conscious of my airspeed, bearing, altitude, any other traffic, communicating with any airports I was passing over, all while looking for landmarks to make sure I was on the right course. While all of these would be fairly easy to do by themselves, when they were all piled on top of each other they became very difficult to keep track of.</p><p>One thing that I learned about myself was that I should have more confidence in myself when trying new things. After the first day or two of flying I was feeling very discouraged and overwhelmed by the number of things that I had to keep track of while flying. I thought for a bit that I would never be comfortable or truly enjoy flying because there were far to many things I had to do simultaneously. However I very quickly got better at managing all the tasks and now they are almost second nature. Even though it seemed daunting at first I should have realized that it was well within my capabilities to master this skill.</p><p>The only thing that could have made this project more rewarding for me would have been being able to complete a solo flight. While I have all the skills necessary to do this and would have been able to in the last couple of weeks, due to a medical issue I was not cleared to fly by myself. However that issue will be cleared up over the summer and I will be able to achieve that goal in time.</p><p>I would certainly recommend this project for anybody who is interested in learning to fly because despite its challenges it was incredibly fun and rewarding. It was pretty exciting to actually be controlling and flying a plane myself and I think it would be tough for anyone not to have a good time learning to fly.</p>');

While at Brockton Hospital, I mainly followed the daily schedule of the residents, which comprises attending lectures by the head of the program, examining the patients in the CCU, performing simple procedures, investigating X-Rays and a myriad of tests, etc. In addition, I assisted the nurses in cleaning patients, moving patients, file paper work, and act as a “runner” for supplies. As an added bonus, I spent one night on-call, which required me to stay up all night. While at MGH, I was an active member in the operating rooms of a variety of types of surgery. As well as obviously observing many operations and procedures, I also assisted in the operating room. I helped the nurses by answering the OR phone and aided in prepping the patient for surgery, filling out paper work, and being a “runner” for supplies. As an added bonus, I was able to work in the Simulator Lab, which allowed me to practice doing heart surgery on pig hearts. I also did this ISP with Paul McCallion.</p>','<p>The most rewarding aspect about my ISP was that I finally lived – and now understand and appreciate greater – the life of a doctor. I now truly understand what a person must go through to become a doctor and what good a person can do. Medicine, I now feel, is the most humbling job. Another rewarding aspect of this ISP was that I was able to see procedures that I would never have been able to see if I had been doing anything else. Simply by watching surgeries and how doctors treated patients, I experienced something completely foreign to me (which I always thought was one of the main goals of doing an ISP). In conjunction, what was also rewarding was being able to see how concepts and lessons I had learned in class just weeks before be applied to real life problems and diseases. In other words, I now understand the reason why we all had to memorize the Krebs Cycle in Biology this year!</p><p>The most challenging thing about this ISP was the schedule. Doctors have a very different schedule than that of the rest of the world. Working the long hours, especially on my on-call night, was grueling and shed light on the unglamorous life of a doctor. In addition, the physical component of this ISP was tough. Standing for hours at a time in the OR or while rounding on patients is extremely tiring. Your legs, however, do adapt; by the end of my ISP, I could stand for about three hours without needing a seat.</p><p>On my ISP, I learned that medicine is probably not going to be the path I take in life (but who really knows at 18). Not to say of course that I did not enjoy my ISP or that I do not like medicine, but I feel that medicine may not be right for me. It is a visceral feeling. To become a doctor, one must be completely dedicated to becoming a doctor; you must be fully invested by physically and emotionally. At this point, I am just not sure that I am dedicated enough to the goal necessary to becoming a doctor.</p><p>Of course, this ISP would have been more rewarding had I been able to physically help patients more (i.e. perform more procedures or tests on them and examine them more). However, this could never happen because I am not a doctor and so, it would be unethical and illegal to have me do too much. In short, it would have been nice to do more with the patient, but I understand why that is not feasible.</p><p>I recommend this ISP full-heartedly. However, those who want to do this must first, have – at least initially – some desire to become a doctor and second, be willing to work the hard hours. With desire and determination, this ISP would no doubt be a great choice.</p>');

The goal of my project was to get some experience working at a startup and learn about how a startup operates. At times, I had little work to do and found myself longing for the RL classroom. Although the work I did have was often tedious office work, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet, creating accounts for new users, or stuffing folders with important documents, my job benefited the company and I accomplished my initial goals. I worked mostly for the head of marketing and he was helpful in allowing me to understand the workings of SCVNGR.</p>','<p>Working at SCVNGR for my ISP was my first experience working at an office and allowed me to experience the daily operations of a startup. My first day there, I met most of the employees, who are mostly recent graduates from college with the higher titled positions in their mid to late 30s. However, the CEO, Seth Priebatsch, dropped out of Princeton during his freshmen year and had he stayed in college would have graduated this past Saturday. As a result of the young employees, the work atmosphere was casual, but at the same time, each person worked hard to add value to the company as at a relatively early stage in a startup’s life, each employee matters, even my more trivial tasks.</p><p>For the first few projects I was assigned, I mostly worked with large excel documents, either inputting data, or deleting duplicated information. However, as I completed these tasks, I began to gain more trust with my boss and started working on more interesting assignments. I researched the best methods for facebook advertising, chose pictures for ads, and transferred important information from a program called highrise to an excel document and back to a new highrise account. While all these relatively simple tasks benefitted the company, they also taught me about the workings of a startup, as for each task I would work with different branches of the company. As a result, I would recommend this project to a student who is interested in working at a startup as an adult and who is willing to work hard for five weeks.</p>');

Approximately half my time was spent working at the gym, while the other half was spent training, both at that gym and at The Ring Boxing Club in Boston. The work aspect varied from day to day, but included placing and managing ads using Google AdWords and Facebook; adding potential members to Constant Contact to try to get them into the gym; adding Connors MMA to local internet business directories; and maintaining the gym, through cleaning the mats, taking out the trash, and putting up new things such as dressing room hooks and a white board. During the training parts, I finally got a chance to focus on martial arts. I studied Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Western Boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Mixed Martial Arts.</p>','<p>This project was rewarding in a few ways. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about all the little behind the scenes things that go into running a gym. I got to use different software, play around with web site HTML code, and began to think and seek out ways to better advertise the gym. I also didn’t spend the entire project sitting at a desk. Much of the work was hands on, the sort a (for the most part) one man business owner has to do on his/her own. Also, I can’t understate how good an opportunity it was to finally be able to train consistently in these martial arts. While I had done them before, I had never had the chance to throw myself all in to them. I was doing two sessions per day, with some of the morning sessions effectively lasting for three hours, when John didn’t have a task for me between morning classes, and a member wanted a training partner to roll with. The chance to take a month to experience these different aspects of running a gym has been invaluable, and has only strengthened my dream of someday opening a similar martial arts gym.</p><p>The project was not without its challenges, of course. The biggest challenge was probably training so consistently. These are difficult martial arts, and they take a lot out of you. After my first week, I could barely turn my head. Pushing through the nearly constant soreness and pain was certainly a challenge, but was ultimately one of the most rewarding parts of the project. The project also challenged me to think creatively and figure things out, as I had never done the majority of the tasks asked of me.</p><p>This project has reaffirmed my dream of opening my own martial arts gym. I learned that I have a genuine interest in trying to figure out the best way to bring in new prospective members, knowing that the free training session would be enough to convince most interested prospects to join. I’ve confirmed that putting much of my time into training every day is something I can, and want, to do. And I’ve learned some things about the business of running a gym, things that will make planning to open my own gym far easier, and make the gym itself more likely to succeed.</p><p>I would highly recommend this project to anyone who has a real interest in martial arts, and an interest in the operations behind any sort of small business. However, I would also recommend that they try out the martial art(s) in which they will train for a month or two before deciding on this project. These certainly aren’t for everyone, and if they don’t enjoy it, it will be very difficult to continue the training regimen. If they do enjoy it, and have the interest, this will prove a very fun, very rewarding project choice.</p>');

We all come from different backgrounds but the love of basketball brings us all together—we found the famous phrase “Basketball is a Brotherhood” to ring true.</p><p>Going towards the first court, we both believed that revealing the presence of the camera would be the most challenging part.

Choosing the right camera angles and finding the correct lighting were the hardest parts since neither of us had much experience with a camera.</p><p>The initial goal of the project was to discover the relationship between Boston and basketball but during the past five weeks we have learned more about ourselves than any aspect of the project. We have come to love basketball even more than we did before, appreciate (and suffer) the amount of time and effort that the making a movie demands, and most importantly, we enjoyed the experience of interacting with a broad range of unique characters. It is quite possible that next year we will both double major in sociology and film-making while playing basketball in our spare time!</p><p>As it is often the case with many ISPs, more time would have been helpful to make this experience more rewarding. We had five weeks for this project, enough to fully complete no more than five courts. Although we feel that each one of them is distinct in its own way, we would have liked to visit more courts in Boston to discover the full spectrum. If time permitted, it would have also been interesting to visit other cities such as NYC to compare the personalities of its courts to the ones in Boston—i.e., do our project on an even grander scale (the stuff of dreams!).</p><p>We would most definitely recommend this project. Of course, the subject matter would not appeal to everyone—just to those who are fond of basketball and filmmaking. We are neither the first nor the last to make a film about basketball, but we believe that our passion for both fields (basketball and film) have acted as the catalysts for our dedication to complete an artistic depiction of how the game of basketball lives in Boston.</p>');

I worked with Branko Zugic, a graduate student at Tufts. Before I began lab work, I was required to pass a safety quiz which covered the correct disposal of waste materials and other important safety precautions. Through my work at the lab I learned the procedures, including a three step method to clean flasks and beakers, necessary to minimize impurities and ensure the integrity of our experiments.</p><p>Branko and I focused on the Water Gas Shift reaction (WGS), which is primarily utilized for the production of hydrogen fuel. WGS follows the chemical formula CO + H2O à CO2 + H2. The reaction has a high activation energy, so a catalyst is necessary in order to run the reaction at reasonable reaction conditions. Along with creating an efficient catalyst, we were tasked with understanding the surface chemistry and mechanisms that allowed our catalysts to work.</p><p>Branko’s work centers on the use of carbon nanotubes as a support for the catalysts. Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWNT) are effective at keeping the active platinum particles evenly dispersed when treated with alkali metals, and thus a useful support. Previous studies treated the MWNT by impregnating them with alkali metals and platinum. In our research MWNT go through three treatment phases to further control the creation of Alkali-stabilized Pt-OHx Species, active sites for the catalysis of WGS.  The first step is a nitric acid treatment which introduces oxygen functionalities, carboxyl groups in particular, on the surface. Next we heat them in an Alkali metal solution (sodium acetate, potassium acetate, calcium acetate monohydrate, or cesium acetate), so as to replace the hydrogen atoms in the carboxyl groups to form a stable support for the platinum we plan to add next. The third step is to deposit platinum on the treated nanotubes, creating small (<10 nm) particles that are evenly distributed on the nanotubes’ surfaces.</p><p>My subsection of the research concerns the Alkali metal treatment step. I was tasked with creating four batches of catalyst – one with each of the Alkali metals – and testing each of them for effectiveness. By the end of next week I plan to have finished depositing platinum on each batch, and in the final week of my project, I will begin testing the catalysts. In order to test the treated MWNT, we will run the reaction at different temperatures and test the output of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which are formed in a 1:1 ratio according to the WGS stoichiometry.  The reactant gases (carbon monoxide and water vapor) are carried through a quartz tube containing a packed bed of the catalyst. Any unreacted water vapor is condensed, and then the product gases are run through a gas chromatograph to calculate the conversion.</p>','<p>My month at the NanoCEL lab has provided important research experience and allowed me to become comfortable working in a lab setting. I have gained a solid grasp of the most common procedures involved in chemistry research, as well as a deeper understanding of surface chemistry and nano-catalysis.

However, there were also a number of special duties to which I was assigned very frequently.  These included: attending committee hearings, lobbyist luncheons, constituent breakfasts (and other events in the district).

The spectrum of services offered ranges from home energy assessments, to insulation installment, to ground-up construction of new, ultra-efficient homes. During my time there I was charged with the task of creating a video which as a whole explained the company’s mission and services, but which could also be divided into its constituent segments which would then be used on their own to describe a single aspect of the company. This process took place mostly in NSL’s offices and also in the field where they had employees performing audits (home energy assessments) and installing insulation. For the first week a lot of what I did was to gain context and become grounded in the processes of the company. This included everything from talking with the higher ups in the office, to listening in on customer service calls, to shadowing auditors in the field. The actual legwork of creating the video consisted of capturing footage and editing. To capture footage I was sent out to a multitude of jobs, most of which were located in or very near to Boston. The footage not taken in the field was interviews of company employees conducted at the office.

To capture footage I was sent out to a multitude of jobs, most of which were located in or very near to Boston. Those visits were often frustrating. More often than not I was sent on visits with the intent of capturing specific footage, and upon arrival the crews on those jobs would inform me that they were not performing the task which I wished to capture on film.The footage not taken in the field was interviews of company employees conducted at the office. This too was difficult for several reasons. The people I was trying to interview were always very busy and hard to track down, and in the event that I could sit them down the office was invariably noisy. The entire building was under construction and it was usually hard to find a quiet, well-lit place at the same tine when an employee was open to be interviewed. I was editing continually as I compiled the footage, using Final Cut Express 4 and iMovie.</p><p>Next Step Living is a very dynamic environment right now. The company is growing rapidly; they have about five times as many employees as they did this time last year. This sort of environment is exciting to a certain degree, but it also dictated that I would be pretty self-directed in my project. Beyond that though there was also the difficulty corralling people, the poor organization that sent me on wild goose chases to Mattapan, Milton, Dorchester, and Concord. After wading through a dark attic in Natick I found that when you aren’t wearing a TyVek suit pink fiberglass insulation can really make your skin itch. Despite that, I still enjoyed going out and shooting in the field a lot more than spinning my wheels in the office, waiting all day to conduct a three minute interview.</p><p>I have often toyed with the notion of pursuing a career in film. I can pretty confidently say now that if that were a dream to come to fruition I would not follow it down an avenue as commercial as this. During the time I was at NSL I was frequently told how badly they needed a video for their website and how great it was that I was working towards satisfying that need. Given all the restrictions I am proud of my work towards that goal. It is a difficult thing to dress up grainy footage of insulation being blown in a dark attic or close ups of a sweaty man talking in a small room with dirty white walls and poor acoustics. Ultimately the project was sort of a lonely one. I was surrounded by many friendly, intelligent people all of whom were facing full schedules and plenty of other projects. I might recommend the project to someone if they had a friend to share the work and chew the fat on hour and a half commutes on 93 North. More likely though I would suggest that they pursue a project where they immerse themselves in something of interest in a context where they will not be limited by the attentions of professionals who understandably might not have the available bandwidth to deal with a high school senior on his final project.</p>');

I spent the bulk of the five weeks designing the structure of my hunt, brainstorming ideas for individual puzzles (such as a crossword variation, for instance), actually implementing all these ideas, finding people to test-solve my puzzles, and designing an infrastructure under which the teams solved the Hunt (on Saturday, May 28). A puzzle hunt is basically a bunch of puzzles without instructions in which the main objective is the figure out what you’re supposed to do, rather than actually doing it.</p>','<p>My project was extremely rewarding. I’ve been solving puzzle hunts for years, and it has in the last year become one of my strongest hobbies. I’ve always wanted to try my hand at writing a puzzle hunt myself, because coming up with the ideas behind a hunt, rather than merely discovering them second-hand, has always appealed greatly to me. I learned a lot about the explicit process of writing a hunt, and the ins-and-outs of what exactly makes a good puzzle. Most of all, it was very gratifying to have other people solve and enjoy my puzzles as I have other people’s puzzles for so long—while I of course enjoyed the experience of writing them, it meant a lot that others got something from my work, too. I learned that I am able to take a daunting project and break it into its constituent parts and, via careful planning, to complete it successfully. I also learned that writing puzzles is actually not as mystical and impossible as I had originally thought—when you have a good idea, the puzzle neatly falls into place (though not necessarily quickly—some puzzles took as much as 6 hours to write).</p><p>The most challenging part of the project was brainstorming ideas. Coming up with original puzzle ideas is daunting, especially when you need 18 of them and you’re working independently. Once I had all the ideas, the most difficult part was ensuring that the hunt wasn’t too hard—it’s pretty easy to assume that others will be able to solve a problem you’ve written more easily than they will. I went through several re-writes, often, to decrease difficulty after test-solvers told me that something was too hard.</p><p>The project could only really have been more rewarding had it been able to bigger—I could have reached more people, and also collaborated with others to create a much larger and diverse hunt, featuring a fusion of more than one person’s best ideas. Also, I would have preferred to run the hunt at a central location rather than online—but overall I have few regrets about my experience.</p><p>I would recommend this project only to someone who has experience solving puzzle hunts. They’re different enough from normal crosswords and sudokus that specific knowledge is needed, and I don’t think writing a puzzle hunt should be a person’s first exposure to them. However, if someone has the experience and drive, I think this is an awesome project, and I feel much better for the experience.</p>');

Definitely this project would’ve been more rewarding if we had worked more with the forging processes. This also might have been because the blacksmith was very busy most of the time so he could not find time to help us make a big finished product and that would also have definitely made the whole process more worthwhile.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this project to anyone who is interested in learning a bit about the forging processes, but would advise them to know that they are going to end up doing a lot of the arduous repetitive tasks and hopefully the blacksmith will not always be as busy as he was this past month and they can get to actually make something.

As a result of this project, I was able to see the other side of the classroom, and how difficult it can be. As the teacher, it is up to me to make the kids understand what I am teaching them. For the most part, this means that I have to make the class interesting so that the kids are engaged or else they will do whatever they liked. Getting the kids interested in something is as challenge especially after they transition between classes. There are also challenges with disruptive students or students who do not do any work. Something that would make the project more interesting and rewarding is being able to have more time. We finished our lesson plans, but we never got the chance to see the kids give their speeches. We also couldn’t attend the school’s afternoon projects such as sports. I would recommend this project to someone interested in teaching in the future and gets along well with kids.

Daily I commuted to Central Square in Cambridge to work as an intern at ImprovBoston, a non-profit comedy theater and school. I would work with the staff, including my off-campus advisor Zach Ward, to do whatever was needed for the company each day. I was involved in a number of projects, ranging from a complete reorganization of IB’s prop closet to redeeming vouchers from a deal on Living Social. Secondly, every Sunday I took a class at IB called Sketch 101, where I learned the basics of sketch comedy, and was able to write and produce a short portfolio of sketches. In class, I was able to brainstorm and workshop sketches with my classmates, and get a good feel for the creative process. Finally, my third and most personally fulfilling activity was filming and producing my own work. I took a sketch that I had written in my class, and shot and edited on my own time. Over all, I got to see comedy from a number of different angles, and learn about it as an art form.</p>','<p>Over the four weeks that comprised my Independent Senior Project I decided to take a step into what some may call the “Boston comedy scene.” I began as a schoolboy yearning to test the mettle of his above-average wit and a seeming knack for punch lines outside the hallowed grounds of this little nursery, and set out to find a project that would allow me to learn about as well as write and produce my own comedy. So, with big dreams and a mind buzzing with creativity and potential, I set out to try my hand in the world of comedy. By the end of my time, I was an intern at an Improv theater, studying sketch comedy, and under the direct supervision of a standup comedian. The “big three” of live comedy, sketch, improv, and standup, as I learned early on, were paramount in my world, and I was surrounded by people who had devoted their careers to such pursuits every day. It was through them that I was able to learn about the professional side of comedy, and come to a fuller understanding of the art. However, while a project based on comedy sounds free-spirited and fun, my daily work was, to be quite frank, work. I spent most days in a back-stage office, at a computer, doing anything from taking phone calls to contacting potential ticket buyers. Days when I didn’t find myself in an office chair mostly involved physical labor- runs to the post office, buying maintenance supplies, or transporting of props. On top of that, I had an hour-long commute over car, train, and subway. I was deeply involved in the logistics of an entire theater company with nightly performances and classes in up to five different spaces. It was truly a good deal of work, and far more than I had expected. But, luckily, a few factors kept me from depressing over this fact. Firstly, I was doing good work. Each task I could do well and completely, and was able to reap some satisfaction every day from various “jobs well done.” Secondly, I was surrounded by great people who had genuine passion for their work and their art. I worked closely with three ImprovBoston employees, Dana Jay Bein, MaryBeth Makara, and Zach Ward (my off campus advisor). MaryBeth hosted and performed weekly, Dana taught, performed and directed, and Zach was the managing director of not only the entire company, but additionally of another Improv Theater based in North Caroline. All three were incredibly busy with their various pursuits, but all three were more than happy to do whatever needed to be done. They managed to balance their work with their performance, and to even mesh the two seamlessly, and they helped me do the same. I improved my work ethic, my self-reliance on projects, and my organization skills, as direct results of their influence on me, and was able to stay content and high-spirited throughout. The final aspect of my project was what drew me in from the start - writing. I took a weekly course that was complimentary with my internship called Sketch 101. Every week, I was charged with writing a new sketch to fit a certain theme or idea. In class, my classmates and I would read through and workshop our ideas in a helpful and creative environment. By the time the class was over, each of us had a portfolio of work that we are now able to take with us throughout our comedy careers. This process was understandably quite demanding. Working with deadlines and near-constant writers’ block, on top of endless conflicts and scheduling issues, I was truly challenged in fulfilling the very genesis of my project. Luckily, I was able to pull through. I attended as many classes as I could, took in every ounce of information I could hold, and put together a portfolio that I am truly proud of. Finally, in what was actually the genesis of this project, I got the opportunity to produce some of the work that had taken shape in my Sketch class. One day, I filmed, directed, and edited one of the sketches in my portfolio. This not only adds to my comedic resume but it shows that I am able to produce, from start to finish, a quality piece of film and comedy. Having grown up on video sketches from the likes of Saturday Night Live, MAD TV, and other, this was a great achievement for me. In the end, I really enjoyed my project. Though daily work could feel boring or painful, especially when put ahead of potential creative time or processes, I was able to strike a balance between work and fun that felt both comfortable and realistic. So, if anyone out there has some good sketch ideas, or thinks they can improv, or just likes to make people laugh, I would absolutely recommend this project. Be ready for some hard work and maybe some rough days, but hopefully you, just as I, will be able to pull through and create and further broaden the beloved art of comedy.</p>');

Week 1 of our project primarily consisted of gather supplies and making measurements. Week 2 and 3 was comprised of cutting and assembling the boat. Finally, during week 4 we sealed, painted and tested the boat. This project was extremely rewarding because I was able to work with my hands, something I rarely have the opportunity to do. I don"t often work with wood and, at least before the project, I didn"t know much about working with wood so this ISP allowed me to learn a little bit more about woodworking and boat building. The most rewarding part of the project was testing the boat and in particular, seeing it actually float successfully.  This project was challenging from the start because neither I nor Will had much prior experience with woodworking and certainly not with boat building. Our first major challenge came during the assembly phase, when we had to bend the side piece in order to attach it to the transom. We overcame this challenge through team work and little bit of ingenuity and the boat slowly took form. Another challenge of the project was time management. Although at the start we managed our time poorly, as the ISP went on, Will and I definitely improved a lot in that category. Over the course of this project, I learned that I am actually not terrible with my hands. I now have basic knowledge of how to put stuff together and am confident I could do small woodworking projects like this in the future. Still, not much would have made this project more rewarding for me. If I had to say one thing, however, then it might have been more rewarding if we had the extra time to attach oarlocks and build oars for the boat. To end, I would without a doubt recommend this project. We were able to manage our own time and were not on a strict schedule. The project was for us, we were not working a mundane job for someone else. And therefore, the final outcome, the boat, was entirely ours, a product of our hard work and hands. I think the best part of the project is simply seeing the final product and realizing that you built it. </p>');

Second, I learned a lot about real estate in general not just the commercial side of the business. Lastly, I made good relationships with the associates that work their and I felt like I was actually of use to the company. I learned about myself that I take direction well, and pick things up very quickly. My boss would ask me to do something that he would think would take me four hours and when I would come back in an hour with a nice looking product, he was impressed.</p><p>If you are interested in being in a business setting for a couple weeks, then I think this is a worthwhile experience.

We began our project by emailing a list of veteran alumni requesting information about their terms of service.  Our plan was to create an honor wall, similar to those at national monuments, and use the information we received to create a book with profiles of each veteran.  We asked veterans for their highest rank achieved, conflicts served in, branch of service and other information of that type.  We were surprised by how quickly people responded - 12 responses within 48 hours - but were discouraged when responses slowly stopped coming in.  We combined this research with looking through the school archives and to find all veteran alumni.  We compiled a list of over 150 veterans.  The second portion of our project was to train Jay Shea, fitness trainer at APECS, in order to prepare for our own military service.  He focused on structural balance with us which will be key at the academies.  Because the military places a lot of emphasis on pushups, pull-ups, and sit-ups, a lot of soldiers have overly developed chests and arms while their backs, which support the body, are weak.  This makes them prone to back injury which prevents almost any type of physical activity, even simple tasks like bending over.  He also worked on building our mental toughness or as Rl calls it, "grit," so that we will be better prepared for the tedious regiments at West Point and Annapolis.</p>','<p>This project taught us a lot.  The "Man Challenges" taught us the importance of teamwork and motivation.  For example, during one of our many tests where we were carrying a log above our heads, the fear of letting down your partner kept you going past your limits, both physically and mentally.  We also learned how to scan through pages and pages of information and pick out the small tidbits that we were actually interested in.</p><p>We also realized how just because we were really interested in and excited by our project, other people don"t alwaYS care.  A mere 26 out of the 93 people we reached out to responded to the survey.  While many of the responses we got were very detailed and involved, others were very basic and didn"t even complete our entire questionnaire.  While the small number of responses were disheartening, we were energized and invigorated by the detailed responses.  In addition, there were a number of guys who kept tabs on us throughout the process because they were excited about our project.  This showed us how it is important to get other people involved and interested in your project, otherwise you begin to lose interest yourself.</p>');

I conducted this research on all NBA teams over the past 20 years and had to devote a lot of time to Google-ing and gathering information (who the team’s owners have been for which years + where they lived).

This was an extremely rewarding project overall. It was fun everyday for me to be working in the Celtics offices on projects that I was passionate about. My first research project will end up being read at the league offices, which is, for lack of a better term, unreal. Furthermore it was fantastic to go to work at a place where you get such a rare insider perspective on a team like the Celtics – personal anecdotes from staff members about players and the like. However the most challenging parts of the project were focusing during research when it could get somewhat monotonous or dull trying to figure out who owned the Seattle Supersonics in 1994 and where he lived. But ultimately I learned that, above all else, I’m pretty good at self-motivated, unsupervised projects like the ones I did for Wyc. And that itself was a great experience to have, since at RL we haven’t had too many unsupervised papers or projects like that. Granted, an unsupervised research paper on My Antonia or Their Eyes were Watching God probably wouldn’t end well, but completing a fully self-motivated project on a subject I could get passionate about was a wholly fulfilling enterprise. My only regret is I wish I had more time on the ISP, especially since 1 or 2 days a week are taken by the school and lacrosse practice limited my hours. This project was a once in a lifetime experience though, and I highly recommend working in the Celtics front office to anyone.</p>');

My second trip, I focused on the Art of the Americas wing, specifically looking at woodworking from the 18th century made in America. My project was rewarding because of skills I learned while making the candle box. Knowing how to use the different saws and machines is a great tool. Also, I was very pleased with the way my final product, the candle box, turned out. The most challenging part of the project was how precise all of the measurements and cuts had to be. There was very little room for error, so every cut was measured and re-measured to make sure they were correct. From this project, I learned that I enjoy woodworking and working with the power saws and machines I used in making the candle box. I also learned that I can be very meticulous when necessary. I paid very close attention to details, and this is part of the reason my box came out well. This project would have been more rewarding if I had some previous experience with woodworking and the machines. That way I could have spent more time on the final product, and less time learning about the machines.  I realize however that these basics are essential and given that I had no prior experience, learning about them was very useful. I would recommend this project if you think you are interested in woodworking. Going into it I was not sure that I was, but I found that I really enjoyed woodworking. It was a fun and interesting learning experience.</p>');

Finally, all those sound clips must be edited and produced before becoming a completed track; this process involves equalization, adjustment of volume levels, and application of various effects to each and every track so that they mesh together and form a musically cohesive and coherent piece. At the outset of the project, we had our sights set high—we hoped to do as many as eight or ten songs for our album, and even considered doing a few original compositions along with the cover songs. However, the recording process was far more tedious than we had anticipated. This was one of the first challenges we had to deal with along the way; it is the nature of recording that every little mistake sticks out like a sore thumb. Correcting every one of those mistakes is a time-consuming process—as such, we soon came to realize that we had to make a choice: we could push on for our goal of eight or more tracks, or we could settle for fewer, though more thoroughly completed, tracks. As stated above, we opted for the latter, since we thought the experience would be more valuable if we were able to immerse ourselves thoroughly in the entire process, and not have to cut corners due to a lack of time. Looking back, I believe we made the right decision—we finished our six tracks just in time, but were able to put out a product that we were quite proud of, and we certainly learned a lot in doing so. From doing this project, I learned one important thing about myself, and, in particular, about the standards to which I hold myself and my work. Despite the fact that there is essentially no external motivation for doing this project well, I found that I really wanted to create a good project, and did not settle for anything less than the best work I could put out. Whereas the past six years at Roxbury Latin have been colored by the motivation for getting good grades in order to get into college and whatnot, we had nothing pushing us but our own standards during the ISP period. And, I am proud to say, I discovered that I do take a measure of personal pride and joy in doing good, thorough work, regardless of what is ‘required’ of me. Quite honestly, I do not think the ISP period could have been a more positive experience for me than it has been—other than getting more time (which, of course, is just wishful thinking), there is nothing I can think of that would have greatly enhanced my experience. This project was extremely rewarding for a number of reasons: first, it allowed me to explore in great depth one of my greatest areas of extracurricular interest—music. Second, it was an entirely new and challenging task that I was taking on—never before had I recorded and produced music of this scale and quality. And, finally, I ended the project with something to show for it, a memento of my hard work and enjoyment over the course of my final year at RL. I would highly recommend this project to any future RL seniors who have any interest at all in music or recording. First of all, this is likely the only time for the rest of your lives when you will have an entire month to do nothing but music—this is a rare and valuable opportunity. Second, it is a fantastic complement to RL’s music program; while RL boys are often well versed in performance music, the opportunities to record and produce are few and far between. Last, and certainly not least, it is a lot of fun—for anyone who is passionate about music, and maybe even for those who are casual hobbyists, I can guarantee that this sill be a rewarding experience.</p>');

The tradition was started by Mr. Bob Nyman, and after he passed away, Mrs. Nyman decided to keep the tradition alive. The residents of the nursing home were extremely nice and were ecstatic to have flowers delivered to them. I do not see this trip as one of the best moments of my project, but also as one of my favorite services I have ever done. My project was indeed challenging at times, from keeping up with the meeting with Mr. Malloy’s clients and understanding their concerns to writing reports in Mrs. Nyman’s office, but I got outstanding support and help from Mr. Malloy, Mrs. Nyman, and Lauren. This project certainly made me feel more aware of Massachusetts’s political environment and has prompted me to become more involved in the community in different ways. In the end, I would most certainly recommend my project to another student. The people I got to meet, the knowledge I accumulated, and the tasks that I worked on were all extremely worthwhile, but at the same time I had a lot of fun.    </p>');

We purchased individual parts online and from Home Depot. With the guidance of our off campus advisor we drafted a plan for the building of our guitar that was adjusted weekly when we met with him. We did most of the work in the RL scene shop using a combination of school tools, tools we purchased, and tools Mr. Piper lent to us and showed us how to use. Mr. Piper helped us learn how to utilize tools safely and effectively. We worked from home the first week buying supplies and drafting plans before taking to the RL wood shop in the middle of the second week. For the remaining days we worked in the woodshop and went from five-hour days to much longer days once the athletic seasons ended. By the end of the project we had spent about $250 on supplies and were able to put together the entire guitar besides some of the wiring.</p>','<p>For my ISP I built an electric guitar with Nik Kinney. To begin the project we had to decide on a design for our guitar and draw it out to scale. We chose to make the guitar a basketball themed guitar and hoped to have it built to scale of a backboard, with a rim coming out of it, and a head in the shape of a basketball. To decide what type of wood we needed we asked our off-campus advisor what was the best value. Although some cheaper woods like pine were options, oak was said to have the best sound for any wood in our price range. Once we bought the oak for the body we decided to buy pieces to make our own neck rather than buy a premade neck which is common for most guitar builds. We though making our own neck would be a challenge and allow us to put our own flare to the project. We then had to decide what type of electronics would fit the design of our guitar. </p><p>By the middle of the second week we were working with the wood measuring out what the body would look like. Once we glued the two pieces of oak together we began exploring how to hollow out our heavy wood. We spent a few days experimenting and searching for the tool that would allow us to hollow out our wood the way we wanted to. We then routed out the top of our guitar body to serve as the control cavity where we planned to later put our wiring. We then focused on our neck where we cut out the neck to fit the pre-slotted fingerboard we bought, then we used the extra wood from the cutout to add on to the end of the neck. This created the head. We cut the head out in a circle the shape of a basketball. With most of main woodworking done we focused on sanding, painting, mounting equipment, and figuring out electronics. Sanding the guitar was quite difficult and required many types of sanders and sandpapers as well as wood putty. Painting the guitar was difficult as we had to change paint types when the spray paint recommended to us came out uneven and sticky. We realized that sometimes after initial coats of paints we would have to work the wood and repaint later which took up more time and money than we had hoped. Things like routing out a cavity for the truss rod, routing the head down for playability purposes, sanding the neck to the point where it was rounded and smooth, and sanding the neck at an angle where the nut would go to the strings easily proved difficult. The two hardest tasks were fretting the fingerboard and routing out a hole in the body for the neck to fit in snug. The fretting took two days and the rout for the neck nearly ruined our body when the blade slipped twice and cut into both our control cavity and another part of our body, making significant dents that took hours to repair. Putting on a bridge and drilling holes for the tuners were infuriating tasks as we did not have the perfect tools and had to improvise, yet maintain the perfect straightness and symmetry of our guitar as well as a strict 25.5 inch rule from nut to screws of the bridge. Tools proved to be the greatest obstacle in our project. In addition to spending over $100 on tools we had to learn how to use the tools on the fly. Errors were inevitable, and it often took a lot of time to correct errors. Some errors could not be corrected and called for improvisation. We are so grateful for the guidance of Mr. Buckley and especially Mr. Piper, who both taught us how to use most of the tools we used and let us use them. Finding the right tools and the right parts was the biggest challenge for us, while using some of them (like the table router and jigsaw) were also extremely difficult. To look back at how perfect some of our work had to be and how hard we worked to achieve some things is very rewarding when we look at the (nearly) finished product. We were also able to produce the guitar we envisioned in our minds at the beginning of the project which we had never seen before in person and could not find anything similar online. It was fun to be able to work with a friend and create our own schedule, although it was difficult to resist the temptation of delaying work, especially early on in the project where we did not feel the pressure of an impending deadline. We did not realize how long it would take to gather the right parts, as often we had to order parts online and cross our fingers that they would work, and it didn"t always work out. I learned that I have the ability to be extremely focused and diligent at certain tasks. Sitting and sanding for four hours is neither fun nor easy, and the work you put in on small things is not always appreciated by others, yet I have been able to take pride in stuff I have spent a long time working on. I also learned that it is not easy to find the parts you need or make things look professional. An absurd amount of patience and focus is required to make things work well. I learned that creativity is both a blessing and a curse, as the more creative you get the harder things get. I also learned that when Mr. Piper said 90% of the work we do would be preparation he wasn"t lying. Measure twice cut once is an understatement. The project would be more rewarding if it looked slightly more professional. Some parts of the guitar look slightly imperfect which is frustrating when you spend so much time on it. Also it would be more rewarding if I didn"t have to spend so much on the project, as Nik and I have spent at least $250 combined. I would certainly recommend this project. Being able to have something tangible at the end of the long period is a perk. Also it’s fun to work with someone else and be able to create your own schedule to some extent.</p>');

She is the head of marketing for a new brand of shoe that came out in February.  The shoe itself is similar to a sandal and is made out of a unique type of foam that has been found to absorb almost all force exerted on it.  Studies have shown that it is very good for people with chronic pain in their joints, as well as for people who workout a lot.  We spent our time as Mrs. Finigan’s helpers, performing various tasks and experiencing the ups and downs associated with a young company.  We hit the road and visited local gyms and salons, pitching the shoe to them with the hope that they would sell the shoe in the stores.  We got valuable experience along the way, having opportunities like working at the Boston Marathon Expo in South Boston, interacting with an advertising specialist in Providence, and sitting in on an entrepreneurship class at Harvard Business School.  </p>','<p>When I began the process of trying to pick an ISP, my goal was to pick a project that would inspire me.  I knew this was much easier said than done, but I knew that if I was able to do this successfully, the project would have much more importance than if I picked one in which I had no interest.  Prior to my ISP, I’d always been intrigued by startup companies.  Every company, no matter how big or small, goes through the same initial growing process.  All of them experience the same growing pains along the way.  For me, I thought it would be the most interesting to experience a company at this initial growing stage, rather than work for a company that had already had most of its growth.  In working for OOFOS, I was able to experience the struggle that other fledgling companies like Apple and Nike would have experienced in their early days.  For me, this project has been very rewarding.  It has opened my eyes to the world of startup companies, and has provided me with a possible career in my future.  At the end of our project, Pat and I gave a presentation to the owners of the company.  We thought we did pretty well, but Mrs. Finigan called us up later that night and told us we had thoroughly impressed the owners.  She said that if we continue to work hard in college, a lot of doors will open up for us after our graduation.  While I’m not a 100% sure that I want to pursue a career in entrepreneurship, it’s good to know that I have that as an option going forward. Our project didn’t always go according to plan.  When we hit the sales trail, we had great success the first day, and we assumed that would be the case every day.  When we went back out the next day, every place we visited turned us down, saying they had no interest in the product.  The ups and downs that we experienced in selling the shoe hurt our confidence, but at the same time they showed us the struggle people must endure when working for a startup.  While working on the ISP, l learned several different things about myself.  I learned I could be an effective speaker in front of a group, something I was unsure of going into the project.  I learned that I need to spend more time developing a mastery of technology, specifically Microsoft applications like Power Point and Excel. To make the project a bit more rewarding, I would have hit the sales trail a bit more.  Pat and I went to a good selection of places, but I believe we could have hit more.  If we had done this, we could have had a better idea of what the public’s opinion of the product was, something that’s absolutely crucial for a startup company. For anyone who has a desire to enter the business world after college, I would highly recommend this project.  It gave me valuable experience that not many people get at my age, and I feel I’ll be able to use this experience down the road when I enter the professional world.</p>');

I also created a word document, putting my findings into words for further reference. The main thing that I will take away from this project into the future (in addition to all the things I learned from my research) will be the importance of effective time management. I was given the assignment of researching the topic and coming up with a presentation, and I had four weeks to complete it. That was it. There was no daily or weekly schedule I had to follow, like one would find in school, I did not have to come in everyday nor did I have to stay for any amount of time. I only had to produce this finished project at the end of the four weeks with help from others along the way. Therefore, I scheduled meetings with Frank (mentioned above) that coincided with time tables I set for myself to be done with certain parts of my project to complete it on time. This freedom, to do what I needed to do when I needed to, was also probably my biggest challenge as well. I was not given the overarching structure that I have always received in school and I also had to find the motivation to get things done early without this structure, something that I was not particularly used to. Thankfully I did, and I was able to accomplish my goals in this project. I learned that I work well as an individual. Coming into this project I was a little concerned with what I had to do because I knew that it would be a lot of individual work, something that I did not intend on when thinking about ISP’s. However, I found it surprisingly painless to work alone and especially rewarding when looking back at what I had done and created. This project would have been more rewarding really if I had more time to research and get ready, but also if I was able to see what the company will do with my research, but that will be decided in the future, so my wish may come true. I would recommend this project who is interested in economic and demographic research. I used to do this kind of research for my own sake, but my interests were given a point through this project, and again, it was very rewarding and worth it.</p>');

In addition to classroom activities, I worked with two students individually on Algebra and Science. The second part of my ISP consisted of individual painting. I spent time primarily on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as on some weekends, honing my watercolors painting skills.  Overall, my ISP, or two mini-ISP’s, revealed my lack of patience. Even thought the two projects were completely different, they both showed me that I need to take time in dealing with every situation. As a TA, there were times when students were not receptive to what I said, or were disrespectful despite the fact that I was choosing to help them. And despite the structure of Roxbury Prep, there were students went out of their way to show that they despised the school. And while the teachers had all faced their share of adversity from the student body, the large displays of obnoxiousness from thirteen and fourteen year olds were infuriating. But when I stepped back and saw that some students were acting that way in order to cover up the fact that they did not understand the material and did not want other people to know about it, I realized that getting upset and flustered, and scolding the students was not the way to get through to them. Instead, I need to put more individual time into working with that girl or boy (more often a boy), to make sure they absorb and internalize the material. Furthermore, at times, painting was equally infuriating. While I enjoy painting, especially using watercolors, I found that more often than not, getting my vision to become a reality was impossible. And as a continued trying to add color and detail to the painting, to make it exactly what I wanted it to be, I found that the painting became less and less attractive. So, instead of attacking the paper with the paintbrush, I started planning, and thinking about every stroke I made, prior to actually making it. It took much more time to do this, and was a much slower process, but putting in the time greatly improved the quality of my paintings. Surprisingly, both parts of my project challenged me to change the way I normally do things, and resulted in higher quality products. I would recommend each part of my project individually; however, I think that trying to juggle both parts got very complicated. In order to do something like this, a student needs to be extremely organized, or they will end up scrambling at the last minute to get everything done (which is what happened to me, in part). Also, in order to do a project like this, a student needs to have a lot of energy, especially if they are doing a sport in the afternoon. Overall, I would recommend this project to anyone who has a passion for it, but caution them to not take on more than they can handle.</p>');

Our off campus advisor was Dan Frank, a friend of my family and a film producer for commercials. Our schedule over the four weeks was separated generally into three segments, prep for shooting, shooting, and editing. Our first journey into the world of filmmaking was both exhilarating and strenuous, didactic and disillusioning. Our first step in the right direction was to make sure we had our story and scenes planned out before the ISP period began.  We also made sure to have a storyline that was dialogue-based and easily filmable.  Shooting locations proved an unexpected feat, as first pointed out by our off campus-advisor Mr. Frank.  We secured the Roche Brothers shoot by meeting with the manager and getting a low-business hour window in which to shoot our scene.  We made sure we filmed at the train station at a time when no trains would be coming through. Mr. Frank had warned us early on that Murphy’s rule invariably applied to the shooting process, and that admonition became more right than could have imagined.  During our beach shoot, we suffered from and actor having to leave early, all costumes and props getting soaked by a sudden downpour of rain, and some potential damage to our camera.  A similar law could be applied to the editing process, where the labor was exceptionally tedious and the software was partial to freezing.  The average scene, roughly four minutes, took about six hours to edit. The film suffered as well from factors that were out of our control, such as loud ambient noise on the shoot sites and time restrictions while filming.  If I were to do this project again, I would learn more how to work the camera and frame it for a very professional looking job.  The camera we had was very state-of-the-art, but its series of complex controls and setting seemed at times far over our heads.  A real grip on the very technical aspects of shooting and editing would help take our film to the next level aesthetically.  I would also plan our filming sessions more ahead of time.  One problem we had was running out of time on shoots because we took our time getting all the shots we need.  We could have prepared our actors better and written down an exact shot-by-shot plan.</p><p>I learned more from this project than I ever could have imagined, and this experience has opened my eyes not just to the art of filming, but the dedication and planning needed to put a big project like this together.  I should also not that I had originally intended to do a film alone, but then joined up with Steele.  That in hindsight was a life-saving decision, because this film would have been impossible for anyone to do by themselves.</p>');

At 3:00 my day was done. Everyday during my ISP I enjoyed my time with the kindergarteners.  They were very accepting of me and I quickly became their friend.  One thing I learned as a teacher is that while being their friend was a lot more fun, it made discipline more difficult.  It was sometimes hard, if not impossible, to get them to stop trying to have fun with me and get to work.  Nevertheless I think we all enjoyed my time there.  Working with these kids was especially rewarding for me.  As an alumnus of that very same kindergarten teacher, going back and reliving that experience was fascinating.  I found it interesting to compare my work as a kindergartener, saved for the past twelve years, to this latest group.  Going in, I thought I would compare favorably, however it was much closer than I thought.  Some of them actually produced better work than I. The fifth graders were more boring.  They needed significantly less help and did not involve me as much.  This was not heartbreaking for me, but it did mean that my time with them often felt wasted.  There were days where I contributed nothing to the class.  There were days where I had to read a book to pass the time.  These days were far more frequent than I would have liked. Based on my experience here I don’t think I want to be a teacher.  Perhaps it would be different to be the main teacher not just an intern, but having fun and getting things done seem to have an inverse relationship that I want no part of.  Having said all that I would recommend this ISP for others, provided that they go in with a clearer idea of what they want to do, so they don’t end up bored like I was for almost two hours every day.  The kindergarteners were fun and enjoyable and I would work with them again given the chance.  They made the whole ISP worthwhile.</p>');

Because Island Surf is such a small company, with only three employees, Jeremiah and I were doing serious and important work. The project was rewarding because it felt like we were actually helping the company, rather than just doing busy work like filing papers or opening mail. The things we were doing, such as updating the website and reorganizing the warehouse, are things that Mike and Mr. Obrien wanted to do, but just didn"t have the time because they were so busy. It was also rewarding because we got to see what it"s like to work for and run a small business. We got to see everything that Mr. Obrien and Mike were doing and learn what goes into running a small and growing business. It was a challenge because not all of the work we were doing was easy. Unloading the trucks and picking the orders was pretty difficult work and took a lot of time. Doing this work taught me that its not easy to run a business, because these were things that when we weren’t there, Mr. Obrien and Mike would have to do themselves. I would recommend this project to anyone who is willing to do real work. You have to do real work every day, but I think that"s better than doing busy work just to kill time. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in learning about a small business, and willing to work. </p>');

I found the time during which I worked on media and policy particularly engaging and rewarding. The most challenging part of my project was simply the daily grind - there is a lot of fairly menial work that has to get done for campaigns to go forward, and as interns we were responsible for doing a large part of that work. If I had not been as interested and engage in my media and policy work, making it through the daily grind would have been a lot more difficult. I learned that my real interest in the public sector lies in public policy as opposed to the political process itself. I also learned that it is a lot easier for me to do hard work  when I am interested in the work and when I feel it is for a good cause. I would say that my ISP went as well as I could have expected, and there isn"t really too much that I wish I had done differently. A couple of key factors helped make my ISP particularly rewarding. First, I set up my ISP well in advance and started work before many of the other interns arrived. Since I joined the campaign relatively early in the process, I was able to take on more responsibilities. Second, I got off to a good start by impressing the Director of Communications with my first report, which helped me pull in other interesting assignments later in the campaign as opposed to being perpetually relegated to phone banking like many of the other interns.

His schedule is three days in the operating room on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and two clinic days on Tuesday and Friday. During the operating days I would change into scrubs and was able to go into the operating room to see the surgeries up close.

I found many aspects of the ISP to be rewarding. Most importantly though was probably that I really enjoyed everything about the field I was interning in. I have always known I want to take pre-med in college and before the ISP had an inkling that surgeon could be something I might want to consider doing and during the ISP I just became more and more interested in becoming a surgeon. The most challenging part about the ISP was probably the hours. I would need to be in Boston on operating days at 7:00am. It was early but still fairly manageable to get there on time each morning. For one thing I learned about myself is that I do not get nauseous watching open surgery. From day one I had no problem with the incisions. In the bigger picture though, I learned not only do I not have a problem with watching surgery but enjoy it. My ISP was not one where I came out of it knowing that it is something I could not see myself doing but the opposite I enjoyed so many aspects of it.</p><p>It may have been more rewarding if I had come into the ISP with a better understanding of how the knee ankle, and foot joints function prior to the first day. I would recommend this project but only to a kid that truly has interest in surgery and orthopedics. For me it never did but for I could see others getting tired of the routine. It also has to fit with someone that can handle watching open surgery and hospitals in general.</p>');

We found some gems, such as our good friend Leonard, but we were usually stymied by watermarks or associated hoohah. We used this found footage for our opening montage, which we tried to do without any voice-overs or narrating text. The montage covers Gay history in America from the fifties through the nineties. </p><p>We also conducted interviews with the plaintiffs. We went through numerous channels to get the plaintiffs to respond. We used personal connections, we know Hillary and Julie, and we went through GLAD, the organization that filed suit in Massachussetts, to get in contact with the plaintiffs. We then scheduled appointments and set up and filmed the interviews. We used a school camera and our own tripod to set up pretty decent amateur shots. The sound quality and lighting could have been better, but, hey, we can’t all be rocket scientists.</p><p>Last comes the editing process. We have spent the last seven nearly-sleepless nights, trying to learn everything that a college film course teaches you, while simultaneously applying that to our nearly 2 hours of usable footage, which we have edited down to roughly 20 minutes. We aren’t even done yet. We have used the registered version of AVS video editor, which we “acquired” throught the internet. We otherwise would have had to deal with a large and obnoxious watermark right in the middle of our wonderful amateur film. Indeed, much of our film was not filmed by us. Nor found by us. We have also gained an intricate knowledge of media copyright laws, as well as ways around them. Also we have gained a fair appreciation of various media company’s security systems. And in the process of making our documentary, we realized that if we released this film commercially we would drown in 20 years of debt. Ah well, the internet is all about freedom of information anyways. This has probably approached caffeine fueled rant size by now. We would not recommend this project to anyone who is lazy, unoriginal, tactless, or cannot stand unreasonable amounts of sleep deprivation. We, Justice and I, have however enjoyed this project immensely, from the lazy first week, to this last Hanoi-Hilton-esque week. We are swinging quite happily from our thumbs right now. We plan to continue this project into the summer, hopefully working with our off-campus advisor, to make a feature length film. We have another interview lined up this Friday and we will hopefully gather more material with time.</p><p>By the end, we should have a product to submit to an amateur competition. I don’t know much about distribution, but we have a pretty hot product given recent political events i.e. Obama’s pro-gay-marriage announcement. Given the way things are speeding up, this could be a pretty big documentary, provided we approach it in a professional manner.</p>');

When one of my co-workers made a suggestion or revision on a piece of work I presented her, even the smallest suggestions can sometimes take hours to correct. I was also lucky to work with a friendly group of college girls, so there was not very much pressure to perform, although there were several deadlines for menus which took up several of my nights before the work was due. The work environment was professional, and being in the Prudential Center made the job more fun. Coming in every morning among the masses of the publicly transported was entertaining as well as devastating. Trying to catch the green line outbound from the Hynes Convention Center once took a memorable 1 ½ hours. Overall I would recommend this type of ISP to anyone who is interested in experiencing office work in a professional setting. </p>');

Our project was rewarding in several ways.  First, we were able to help less fortunate families to receive quality, affordable housing.  We got a chance to work directly with these families that will be moving into the houses.  Second, we were not stuck in an office all day, but rather got to work outside with our hands and enjoy the warm weather.  Also, we picked up some valuable construction and maintenance skills which will surely come in handy.  We encountered few challenges.  The greatest challenge was likely scheduling.  Each week we emailed Gerry Patton, the construction supervisor, who provided us with the following week’s schedule.  Unfortunately, we often received the schedule late Sunday or early Monday morning so there was little time to make changes.  Our original plan had included at least one day at the Boston Corporate Office.  Nevertheless, Gerry had difficulty fitting us in at the office.  Our lack of construction experience prevented us from performing certain tasks without some added guidance.  During our project, we learned that we are able to make good decisions when left to our own devices.  For the most part, the site supervisors gave us a task and sent us on our way.  Occasionally, we encountered obstacles and had to rely on our instincts to lead us in the right direction.  We often doubted ourselves, only to find that we were performing the task correctly.  We left the project with a newfound confidence in our own decision-making skills.Had we been able to spend a day at the Boston Office this experience would have been more rewarding.  We would have been able to take a look at the inner workings of a non-profit organization.  We would recommend this project to up-and-coming seniors.  It’s a rewarding experience as you get to give back to your community and develop useful skills.  We would however recommend that this project be done with a partner as some of the tasks can be monotonous. We were grateful for this experience.   </p>');

We also helped to reorganize the Library to make it more accessible to the students by moving the most read books into direct view.  Last, we played basketball with the 6th graders nearly every day after lunch. It was really rewarding to work with the kids and watch them open up to us.  At first the students were shy and did not often seek our help.  Yet, as we were there longer and as they became more comfortable with us, we were able to work with them more and more.  Some of the students struggled with their work but when we helped them or set them on the right path, it was great to see their joy and gratitude in having figured it out.  Also, interacting and playing basketball with the kids out of class and bringing some joy to their long day was very satisfying for me.  However, there were some challenges we faced.  Especially early on when we covered classes it was difficult to keep the students totally focused.  Every now and then they would get a little distracted, which put us in a difficult position in attempting to get them back to work.  Yet, this was not too big of an issue and after a few days we got more comfortable in dealing with this. I learned that I am very fortunate to have the life, family and school that I do.  Most of the kids come from troubled areas and are at school for about 12 hours a day.  It is certainly not easy but they do it with a smile on their faces, which makes me appreciate all the support I get from my family, teachers and friends.  I also learned how to better help people and that I enjoyed it.  Working with these students gave me a good perspective on my own fortune and ability to help others. This project would have been a little more rewarding if we had got more time working with the students.  It would have been nice to help students with their work outside of the ones we worked with on a regular basis.  However, this late in the year teachers like to keep all their students in the classroom so there isn"t much room for individual tutoring.  But if there was a way we could have worked that out I would have enjoyed more direct help and tutoring with more students. I would recommend this project as it was involved and rewarding.  We were not sitting around filing or cleaning but rather engaged with the students and school.  We were able to organize the public speech unit and really get involved and have a say.  Certain ISPs can be more monotonous but we were doing fun work while there and were actually helpful to the school community.  Working at the Epiphany School is a rewarding project that I would recommend to any senior. </p>');

Alice Peisch, my local state representative. In this capacity, I reported to the Representative’s staff director, Alice O’Leary, who gave me tasks throughout each day. My responsibilities ranged from constituent correspondence to researchto attending meetings. In constituent correspondence, I spent time learning about the issues that constituents had written to the Representative about, and then drafting emails orletters in response. For research, I split time between researching specific policy issues and looking at bills and amendments already in place. Finally, I attended a number of events, briefings and meetings that took place in the State House on behalf of the Representative, often taking notes and reporting back on what I heard. </p>','<p>The most rewarding part of my ISP was drafting full-length letters to constituents and interacting with the staff in the office. Towards the beginning of the internship, I was asked to draft formulaic email responses to constituents, each one no more than a few sentences. By using both a massive excel spreadsheet and an online version of the budget, I wrote short notes relating the success or failure of specific amendments. However, in the later weeks, I began writing more expansive letters to constituents. Rather than filling in the blanks of some formula, I was asked to read about a given issue or bill and then draft a detailed letter in response, sometimes a page or two long. With this greater freedom I felt like I was beginning to take on a more significant role in the office, which made my work seem more worthwhile. Additionally,talking with my supervisor, Alli O’Leary, some of the research analysts and occasionally even the Representative proved to be some of the most rewarding time spent there. As someone who has always been interested in politics, the chance to ask questions to people who have spent years in the profession was exciting and rewarding. I remember one conversation in particular I had with one of the research analysts, Diana, who talked about some of the challenges to passing effective education policy. The most challenging thing about the internship was probably staying positive and enthusiastic about all my work, which was often monotonous and tedious. At times my contributions felt meaningless, and it was easy to grow bored and frustrated with the hours staring at a spreadsheet or perusing a budget. However, I found that after I had decided to be positive no matter what I was doing, the whole internship became far more fun and rewarding. Probably the biggest thing I learned about myself was that attitude is something that I could control, and found that after consciously working to stay positive, the whole experience was vastly improved. The only that would have made this project more rewarding for me would have been to have come into it with more reasonable expectations. Approaching my project, I had a sort of fuzzy notion that I would be making an enormous contribution to the Representative. This set me up for some early disappointment, before I readjusted my expectations and went on to have a very positive experience. I would recommend this project to someone determined to gain a window into the world of state politics. But, although I enjoyed the experience, I wish I had done something a little different than my focus. </p>');

Lastly, I visited the State House with Dorothy, who wanted to lobby the Dedham state representative for a liquor license at an HSL location. My ISP was rewarding for me because I was able to help out in whatever way possible at CCB. It felt like pure community service, which I enjoyed. The staff didn’t really have anyone that could assist them, so I was happy to offer that. Also, I felt that it was important for me to try to connect with and give back to the Jewish community somehow. I believe that CCB does a lot of quality work with Jews of all economic backgrounds, and I wanted to participate in that. Going to the Greater Boston Food Bank was mostly unrelated to my ISP but still rewarding, as I got the chance to support a great organization. Finally, my trip to the State House was probably the most rewarding in terms of my interests. While there, I had the opportunity to watch Dorothy, a very experienced politician, meet with the Dedham rep. and thus see how lobbying works. Further, Dorothy ran into many other politicians and gave me a tour of many areas of the State House, making it an overall great trip. This project was challenging, at times, because my daily activities could get monotonous. However, I was almost always kept busy, so it wasn’t too much of a problem. In addition, it was challenging for me to interact with the residents at times, since some were senile, very angry, unhappy, and/or vocally prejudiced. In this sense, I was sometimes saddened or surprised by what I saw or heard. Overall, my experience showed me how interested in politics I am and that I would like to investigate the field further. Also, I was able to relate to many of the residents because they had very similar backgrounds to my own relatives. In this way, I was able to learn and think more about my own family’s history. I think that if the political aspect had been a greater part of my project, my ISP would have been more rewarding. My reasons for doing this project—proximity to my house and desire to connect with Jews—were pretty unique to my own situation, so it’s tough to recommend this project. Also, it ended up being a lot of busy work, so it probably wouldn’t interest too many kids.</p>');

The words and advice about college and my future with the Reverend and an associate, Artis Cooper, were definitely the most rewarding parts of the experience. Those two guys really provided some wisdom and interesting conversation as well as a summer job. I would have to say the most challenging part of the job was presented by the Reverend as well. He is the type of guy to have a thousand things going on at once, and request and commands come in sporadic bunches, and often time there were many things to be done at once, then many “slower stretches” where your not exactly sure what to do. It was also difficult because the Reverend isn’t always the easiest person to contact and sometime one might have to go through many avenues to reach him. The lack of a structured schedule as there is in school probably presented the most difficult challenge. I learned that in the eyes of people who are in the working world. I am very well prepared for college and the world beyond high school because people tended to be impressed by my efficiency and effectiveness when assigned a task. I think the only thing that would have made this project more rewarding would be a more balanced pattern of work and more firsthand contact with fundraiser types and more time spent in the academic realm at Harvard as opposed to the more street-level work I did. If one is into community issues, crime, urban sciences and sociology I would definitely recommend this project especially I f one is a good multi-tasker or fan of storytelling.</p>');

Once a song had enough tracks to feel the rhythm we transferred it to the producing program, Digital performer, on the computer in the studio. Then Mr. Christensen, one of our unofficial yet vital off-campus advisors, would lay down the drum tracks, we would add any remaining tracks as they were recorded, and then produce the song. Although we were able to use much less of our time producing, this had enormous effects on the quality of the final product. Through EQ’ing, adding effects, and riding the volume of each individual track, we polished our songs to a great extent and ultimately turned the sound from amateurish to a much more legitimate quality.

Every day of the first couple weeks we came in to either Meadowbrook or RL and laid down the individual tracks for each song: bass, guitars, solo and harmonies, etc. Since Meadowbrook’s mixer was out until the very end of our project, this had to be done one track at a time, so this portion took up the majority of our time and ultimately limited the number of songs we produced. Once a song had enough tracks to feel the rhythm we transferred it to the producing program, Digital performer, on the computer in the studio. Then Mr. Christensen, one of our unofficial yet vital off-campus advisors, would lay down the drum tracks, we would add any remaining tracks as they were recorded, and then produce the song. Although we were able to use much less of our time producing, this had enormous effects on the quality of the final product. Through EQ’ing, adding effects, and riding the volume of each individual track, we polished our songs to a great extent and ultimately turned the sound from amateurish to a much more legitimate quality. In choosing quality over quantity, we were ultimately only able to produce a six-song album, but we both feel it was well worth the trade-off. I certainly feel that this project was rewarding, both tangibly and intangibly. Obviously we produced a physical album of songs that we can listen to down the road, perhaps while perusing the Yearbook after a reunion and reminiscing with friends. But I digress. It was also rewarding in that we had to manage our own time, sometimes wisely, other times not so much. We also both gained a much greater appreciation for the difficulties and intricacies of such a production; I don’t think either of us will listen to studio music the same way again. We learned that sometimes it takes long hours to finish something when it’s coming to the end, but although we went right down to the wire, we did complete the album successfully. We learned that when there is an issue or problem that only you really care about (in this case Meadowbrook’s mixer being in the repair shop), you have to be the ones making sure it gets fixed. We only got the mixer back when we hounded the guy and actually drove over to Waltham to get it. Despite the setbacks, I would definitely recommend this project to anyone musically inclined, whether that’s instruments only or the production side, you can always pair up with somebody and produce some really great stuff and have fun doing it. There will be many opportunities over summers and at other times to get “more serious” internships or, god forbid, real jobs, but this is really your one and only chance to sit down with a great friend for a month and do nothing but record music. And if you’re thinking of doing something like this, Meadowbrook is a great place for it. </p>');

After this we also continued marketing work by putting together contacts for an e-mail blast which we were designing. The most rewarding aspect of this project was the professional experience gained.  Marketing and sales were the two areas which the project was based on.  Marketing was used when we were developing the tier strategy for the product and the company"s future.  Also, we went to the offices at Fuzion and were able to talk about new designs that would help better market and sell the product.  Sales was the other main area of professional experience gained by the project.  Thomas and I both experienced the ups and downs of trying to sell a project to the outside world.  We struggled a lot with selling the product at first and did not really feel comfortable with the process.  So, this would have had to be the hardest and most challenging part of the project. However, we did have some success in selling the product as well which was very rewarding.  Along with sales and marketing, finance and technology were other areas of professional experience gained by the project.  During this process, I realized that running a business, no matter what the size, is difficult.  There are so many different things happening at once and quickly.  Even though OOFOS is a start-up company, there is still meticulous thought that goes behind each decision, large or small.  Although this may seem trivial, it was something I noticed during this project.  I also realized that marketing or sales is something that I could see myself doing when I am older.  I like being a part of something on the cutting edge which could become popular or could breakthrough at any time.  I would definitely recommend this project for later years.  If anyone is interested in business or sales this would definitely be a great project to get a glimpse into what that is like.  </p>');

Briefly describe your project and daily activities:  For the past month, I have been a member of the Artful Adventures Program at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Artful Adventures is a program which guides a variety of groups, from pre-K and high school seniors to home-schoolers and Girl Scouts, around the museum’s plethora of exhibits.

What was rewarding about your project?  It was refreshing to see people so excited about art. At RL, there aren’t many kids who know about art history, but at the MFA, everyone’s life revolves around the museum and its pieces, and all my coworkers (who were almost all college students) loved discussing the various exhibits with me. I really enjoyed the environment I was in, and it was so rewarding just to be immersed in the world of art for a month. I also loved seeing the enthusiasm of the kids that came on the tours, as they were so anxious to learn and apply the knowledge they had from school. </p><p>3. What was challenging about your project? Overall, my project was very laidback, and I wasn’t met with many challenges. I’d say my only challenge was trying to use my time efficiently and balancing play rehearsals (I was in Annie at Ursuline Academy) with my project hours (9:30AM-4PM). </p><p>4. What did you learn about yourself as a result of this experience? I discovered how passionate I am about art history and learned how to appreciate art better. I had always enjoyed going to museums, especially after my RL trip to Rome my sophomore year, but I had never known about the history behind the paintings or sculptures. After learning and reading about the pieces in the MFA, I discovered how fascinating and meaningful each piece of art can be, and how each has its own story. I now want to take art history classes at Dartmouth. I also became more enlightened as to how to appreciate art, and not just demean a canvas with a few black lines and splotches of color as “trash”. The tour guides showed me how every art piece doesn’t have to be a Monet or Renoir to be “great”, but it can be great through its technique, use of material, the way it makes you ponder, or the way it behaves with light to name a few.  </p><p>5. What would have made this project more rewarding for you? I only wish I had given more tours. The first two weeks weren’t all that thrilling, as I was just listening to tours, and felt like a student again. I felt that I could have given tours a lot earlier, especially because they aren’t terribly in depth, and they don’t require a degree in art history, rather a night’s preparation to review the four or five pieces you will give the next day. Also, I wish I could have stayed longer at the museum each day, as there were often tours or off-museum projects after 4PM. The three of four times we had to skip a day and be at RL for meetings and APs was also frustrating, because these only took time away from my valuable time at the MFA.</p><p>6. Would you recommend this project? Why or why not? I would definitely recommend this project to anyone who enjoys art. It is a great opportunity to learn about the art history, and you have one of the greatest museums in the country at your disposal. There was never a dull moment during my month, as I always was occupied with tours, art projects, reading, or simply enjoying the exhibits. The people I worked with were so interesting and friendly, as most of them were college interns themselves, and I spent a good portion of each day spending time with them in the art studio. Listening to other seniors’ projects, which often were just making the same phone call, sealing envelopes, or sitting at a computer all day, I know my project was a lot more active, hands-on, and enjoyable, as everyday was something new and fun. </p>');

Before the project we had a vague idea of what that entailed: ordering parts, cutting the wood, wiring the guitar, and painting it. We started by creating a design and plan for the guitar that was approved by our off campus advisor. We met weekly with our off campus advisor to change that plan and ask our numerous questions. We did most of the woodworking in the RL woodshop with the considerable aid of Mr. Piper and Mr. Buckley, both of whom were invaluable to the project. The project was much more difficult and complicated than we initially envisioned, both due to our ambitious design and inexperienced woodworking. We worked from between 9 and 10 to the start of practice every day in the woodshop, and once athletics were over we worked very long hours to try to push the guitar over the finish line. </p><p>The total money we spent ordering supplies and tools was about $250, also more than we envisioned. We were able to put together the entire guitar, but we were not able to finish the wiring or some of the more ambitious design plans, which we hope to finish over the summer. </p>','<p>For my ISP I built an electric guitar with BenjCoen. Initially, we had a very vague idea of what that entailed, and during the project we had to learn very quickly on the fly. During the first week of the project, we drafted the designs of our guitar. We wanted it to be basketball themed, which eventually evolved into Celtics themed as the Celtics advanced further and further into the playoffs. Our design was very unorthodox and ambitious, we wanted a square guitar in the shape of an NBA backboard with a rim extending from it, and we wanted a circular, basketball shaped headstock. We also hoped to lavishly decorate the body and neck with NBA logos and Celtics championship banners as well as retired numbers. Also during the first week of the project we bought our body wood and ordered our parts. We had the option to make our guitar out of pine or birch, but we chose oak for its sturdiness and good sound quality, but it was the sturdiness of the oak that gave us problems working with it later on. Against the advice of our off campus advisor, we decided not to buy a premade neck, thinking that buying a neck blank and separate fingerboard would permit us to more ambitiously design the neck and headstock shape and decorations. During the second week of the project we started working with the wood in the RL sceneshop. We spent the first three days of week 2 looking for the right tools and learning how to use these tools. Then with the considerable help of Mr. Piper and Mr. Buckley, we began cutting. We hollowed out the backside of our guitar to counter its top heaviness and imbalance. We then started routing the control cavity where the guitar wires go. During the third week we finished routing the control cavity, we cut out the neck and headstock, and cut the headstock into a circular shape. We also cut out the outline of the body and the cutout at the base of the neck. This took care of most of the woodworking, so during the rest of the third week we started to sand and paint. Sanding the guitar was extremely difficult and tedious, and required many trips  to home depot for more sandpaper. During the fourth and final week we put in a herculean effort to finish the guitar. We finished sanding the body and rounding the back of the neck by hand, a task which took us a very long time to finish. We routed out a thin cavity in the neck for the truss rod, a stabilizing device. This rout was probably the most difficult cut we made during the whole project as we did not have the right bit for the job, and had to improvise. We also had to rout the head to create and angle between the fretboard and tuners, and then sand the end of the neck and fingerboard down to accommodate this. Doing the fretwork was possible the most tedious and frustrating task of them all, as we did not have the right equipment and again had to improvise, using clamps, tape, and sandpaper to keep the frets in place and looking good. The rout creating the neck pocket almost cost us the project as the blade caught in the wood, throwing the guitar forward and cutting into the body. These mishaps cost us valuable hours applying wood putty and therefore being unable to work on the body while it dried. We again had to improvise installing the bridge, nut, and tuners, as again we lacked the right tools, and had to drill endless, incorrectly sized holes and pilot holes for screws. The measurements for this installation also had to be perfect, and making a perfect measurement is no easy task. This project was at times frustrating and at times extremely enjoyable. Our initial inexpierience with the tools and the improvisation we had to do at the end were the two main obstacles we faced. I am extremely proud of the countless obstacles we encountered in the last week of the project and the problem solving skills we employed to get around this obstacles using the incorrect tools for the job. This is one of the main skills I utilized the most and learned the most about. I also learned that patience and precision is required when working with your hands, as most of our time in the woodshop was spent planning out our cuts rather than actually cutting. Patience and precision were both required immensely when fine-tuning the details of the project, like filing down the frets or rounding the neck by hand. But the finished product that we created makes this project extremely rewarding, as we now have something tangible that we can say we created from scratch ourselves. Time management and creating our own schedule was also important The project would have been more rewarding if we had achieved all the goals we set out to achive initially, namely finishing the wiring, making the guitar look more professional, and finishing our decorations, but nevertheless this project has been extremely rewarding and I recommend it to anyone who likes the idea of using creative freedom, and also having the freedom to make their own schedule, driving themselves, and setting their own deadlines. </p>');

My time there composed of two major projects that focused on marketing CATZ in nearby communities. The first project I took on was developing a spreadsheet of all the Soccer/lacrosse Camps and Road Races in the area. The Director of Communications at CATZ wanted me to find venues where CATZ could send trainers in order to market their brand. For example at sports camps, CATZ trainers would warm-up the athletes and later hold a combine involving athletic tests. The second project was a project I proposed, which was a summer baseball-training program at CATZ. After the project was passed, I spent my time formulating emails to send to coaches, creating a flier, making a Facebook page and helping out with the catzneedham website. In conclusion, my ISP involved sports marketing, social media, and communications that all together created a tremendous real world learning experience.</p>','<p>For my Senior Project I helped out with Sports Marketing at CATZ (Competitive Athletic Training Zone) in Needham. I worked with the Director of Communications, Ian Kilpatrick, and the Director of Performance, Mark Cinelli, who both gave me projects that helped market the CATZ brand. I spent time researching Camps, Clinics and Road Races at which CATZ could find a way to help with the venue or market their brand. I, along with Ian, had to find anyway possible to obtain this information, which meant a lot of time searching on the computer. After that spreadsheet had been made which included the event, time, location, and contact of all local camps and road races, I suggested an idea that could help make CATZ more reputable. My idea was to create a Summer Baseball Training Program that Mark Cinelli, former San Diego Padres Strength and Conditioning Coach, could lead and direct.  Although some baseball players in the area have worked out at CATZ, I knew that many baseball players had no knowledge of Mark Cinelli’s baseball background. My job stemmed directly from that: inform people about Mark’s expertise. The major learning experience from this project was to communicate with my colleagues how I could help them. If I had never brought up the baseball project then I would have probably spent the last two weeks doing useless research on my computer. However because I suggested a project that I could lead and contribute to, it made my experience much more rewarding. What I found challenging was trying to get emails passed that I wrote or changes to the website that I wanted to make. Because I needed Ian’s approval and he needed Mark’s approval it made getting tasks done very difficult. I did learn about myself as well during this experience. I discovered the importance of communicating with different types of people and creating relationships. It made it much easier once I got to know everyone working around me and understanding his or her roles in the business. It was important to show everyone that I was capable of making an impact opposed to just wasting my time listening to music on the computer. On the first day my advisor, Ian Kilpatrick, told me, “Dave, you don’t just have to pound out work the whole time, you know.” I think by showing him my interest in the work and willingness to help, it allowed him to put trust in me with more significant work. I would suggest this project to anyone interested in athletic training and sports marketing for a variety of reasons. First, I developed a perspective of CATZ more as a business and brand name rather than just a place where trainers give workout plans. There is much more depth that I initially realized, such as the marketing, the organization, the work outside the facility, and the trainer/client relationships that make the facility unique. Another reason is for the upbeat atmosphere. Its fun during Ian’s and my hour workout breaks to hang out with all the trainers and athletes. Lastly, I found that I made an impact at CATZ and I was not the annoying kid at the cubicle. By working at a smaller business I was given the opportunity to make a difference</p>');

In the magistrate session there were also a lot of boring cases. Most involved the attorneys giving the court some papers and setting the next date to meet. Staying focused and alert through all this took some effort. I think it would have been more engaging if I knew what was going on in each case, but with so many of them, that would be impossible. While it was rewarding learning about how the criminal justice system functions and what everyone does, I would have liked to have some more responsibility. I was helping, but sometimes it felt like I was not doing very much with my time in the magistrate session. On the other hand, I fully understand that giving a teenager an important role in working on criminal cases is rather irresponsible—and probably illegal. I would not recommend this project to everyone. There is a lot of waiting around and if you do not take advantage of the situation you will not get very much out of the experience. There is the opportunity to talk to (or play Words with Friends with) ADAs and defense attorneys about what they do, but you need to engage them during down time. If you are fully invested in the project it is a rewarding foray into the real world of criminals and those that deal with them. However, it could also be a disappointing and boring project if you are not interested in what is going on.</p>');

The montage covers Gay history in America from the fifties through the nineties. </p><p>We also conducted interviews with the plaintiffs. We went through numerous channels to get the plaintiffs to respond. We used personal connections, we know Hillary and Julie, and we went through GLAD, the organization that filed suit in Massachussetts, to get in contact with the plaintiffs.

The sound quality and lighting could have been better, but, hey, we can’t all be rocket scientists.</p><p>Last comes the editing process. We have spent the last seven nearly-sleepless nights, trying to learn everything that a college film course teaches you, while simultaneously applying that to our nearly 2 hours of usable footage, which we have edited down to roughly 20 minutes.

We otherwise would have had to deal with a large and obnoxious watermark right in the middle of our wonderful amateur film. Indeed, much of our film was not filmed by us. Nor found by us. We have also gained an intricate knowledge of media copyright laws, as well as ways around them. Also we have gained a fair appreciation of various media company’s security systems. And in the process of making our documentary, we realized that if we released this film commercially we would drown in 20 years of debt.

I found that having to speak French in order to communicate, and not just in a classroom setting was not only enjoyable, but extremely beneficial for my French. I enjoy the language and would like to continue it in college and hopefully do a semester abroad in France. On a lesser note, I enjoyed getting to know my way around Boston as a working man. It was great for my sense of direction. My ISP opened my eyes to the working world in a way that was fun and educational. For me the most challenging part of my project was keeping myself engaged in parts of my project that I found tedious or easy. For example looking for field-trips during the summer on the internet was not very challenging and I found it difficult to stay interested. Also I often finished my work in a shorter time than my advisor anticipated, so I had to find new things to do without instruction. I learned that I want to continue French and that I have a passion for a language. I also learned that I do not want to have a job where I sit at a desk all day. That being said, I would have found my project more rewarding if I were able to participate in more classes. I would recommend this project to anyone who has a serious passion for French or wants to test out their skills. ON a few occasions, I had people ask where I was from in France; so obviously, it was good practice in the language.</p>');

Overall, this project has given me a greater understanding of real-world scientific research as well as a unique perspective on how science and statistics come together to produce and analyze data. One of the most rewarding aspects of my project was the fact that my work was an essential part in the bigger scheme of what the Smith lab seeks to accomplish. The results of the ELISA run on HB-EGF protein can now be used as part of a planned abstract to be published by Dr. Smith’s lab around October. The data we collected from the HGF ELISA provides an interesting contradiction (as my results differed from those of my boss) and can be explored using further ELISAs and other tests. The Bradford protein assays that I conducted provide potential for a link between protein concentration and concentration of HGF or HB-EGF, two critical biomarkers for early discovery of cancer. My project was especially challenging, as it put to the test the knowledge and skills that I have learned in RL science courses (physics, advanced chemistry, and advanced biology) since sophomore year. It allowed me to use some lab skills that I had developed in class, while learning a few new ones as well. While understanding some of the mechanisms and concepts behind the tests were a little difficult at first, I came to understand them with the help of my bosses. Due to the labor-intensive and repetitive nature of the ELISA assays, there was a certain amount of tedium to the work that I did, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I learned that scientific research could very well be the future for me. I really enjoyed my time in the Smith Lab, and took pride in my efforts, despite the tedious nature of some of the tasks. I proved to be a capable member of the lab, handling the ELISAs with skill and precision. However, there is one element that I was unable to accomplish that would have really brought a new dimension to my ISP. Due to scheduling conflicts with Dr. Smith and his absence for a conference, I was unable to witness a surgery in the operating room. Having this experience would have given me not only a firsthand look at the laboratory side of research, but also an detailed look at the more immediate and hands-on aspects of science (surgery). I would absolutely recommend this ISP to future seniors. I found it to be an extremely enlightening and rewarding. I would not recommend this to someone who lacks a strong interest in science. One needs to enjoy and have a passion for the intricate details and protocols necessary to carry out this graduate-level research. Someone interested in this ISP would also need to be able to look at the big picture and see how his work fits in the broader goals of the laboratory. He must also be able to work through tedious and repetitive tasks, delaying gratification; he must also be able to understand failure, because I know now that even the most well thought-out hypothesis often come up short.</p>');

By researching the other companies and how their IPOs had played out, I was tried to predict how the Facebook IPO would go.  One challenge that I met early on the ISP was staying engaged with the material.  Going into the project, I thought that I would be sufficiently prepared after taking the AP Economics course.  However, I found it difficult at first to read through the SEC filings.  There were many terms that I came across which I didn’t understand and had to look up.  The material itself was also dry at some points.  Both of these difficulties made it hard for me to motivate myself and stay interested.  However, after about a week, I had learned enough so that I could understand the information well, and I also knew what parts of the filings were essential enough for me to read carefully, and what parts were trivial enough for me to gloss over.  I selected and started my ISP wondering whether investment management would be a good career for me.  I found the work of my ISP to be dry and uninteresting at some points.  One part which I did find interesting when researching the companies was what their problems and the solutions that the companies were trying to find.  I realized that a portfolio manager would not be interested in these problems so that they would try to fix them, instead he or she would simply view it as a factor in deciding to invest.  Although it is still too early for me to choose a career, my ISP made me think that I would not enjoy a career that involved only manipulating money.  I would recommend this project to anyone who is interested in economics.  I chose to do this project because I had enjoyed the economics course, and I found I was able to apply my knowledge from the classroom into this project.  I was also able to learn more about economics during this project, just be reading the materials and attending the conference.  </p>');

We did the majority of the work at Michael’s house given the space he had in his garage and the access we had there to his father’s woodworking tools. As the first talk of I.S.P.’s arrived, I knew I didn’t want to partake in a “standard” I.S.P. for my last month of senior year.  By “standard” I mean the usual 8:30 to 2:30 gig interning somewhere or teaching or something of the like.  These projects have undoubted value, but I wanted to seize this rare opportunity to pursue something I have never pursued- woodworking.  With encouragement from my advisor, Mr. Pojman, and sufficient inspiration from last year’s seniors I decided on what my specific project would be.  Building this boat has been extremely enjoyable, as each step in the process has been completely new to me.  There was always a new and exciting skill to learn, be it learning how to properly drill, or mastering the volatile jigsaw, or understanding that you need to apply two coats of paint to anything for it to look good.  This project highlighted the importance of process and organization.  That being said, both of us took part in our fair share of improvisation before the month’s end.  When two novices build something like a boat, there are bound to be differences from the perfect instructions and the actual physical results obtained.  In theory we should have constructed the boat exactly as the online instruction had called for, but due to slight differences in materials, small mistakes, and overall lack of experience we were forced to change certain small steps along the way.  Our result was the same, a watertight boat that floated and looked almost exactly like the one advertised on the sight, only we had to be flexible along the way and trust that our slight improvisations would facilitate our ultimate goal.  There were many challenges along the way.  Waterproofing the boat was difficult because as we pieced together the main structure of the boat we noticed many cracks along the seams, some too large for the epoxy to fill.  We also encountered engineering complications with the construction of the seat. Perhaps the largest challenge was painting the boat without smudging together the two different colors of paint we used. The experience was highly rewarding for me.  We tested the boat in a local lake; I filmed Michael as he paddled around in the lake for five minutes before returning to shore.  The boat didn’t leak at all and performed exactly as it was designed.  It looked good and functioned well. We both felt a great sense of pride after our qualms about the watertight nature of our craft were put to rest.  Not to exaggerate our accomplishment, but we had constructed something of value and of function, something physically permanent.  There is a certain satisfaction in creating something concrete in a world that seems to be based upon intangible success.  I would highly recommend this project to anyone wishing to have a fun, exciting, and challenging I.S.P.</p>');

Our project was rewarding in several ways.  First, we were able to help less fortunate families to receive quality, affordable housing.  We got a chance to work directly with these families that will be moving into the houses.  Second, we were not stuck in an office all day, but rather got to work outside with our hands and enjoy the warm weather.  Also, we picked up some valuable construction and maintenance skills which will surely come in handy.  We encountered few challenges.  The greatest challenge was likely scheduling.  Each week we emailed Gerry Patton, the construction supervisor, who provided us with the following week’s schedule.  Unfortunately, we often received the schedule late Sunday or early Monday morning so there was little time to make changes.  Our original plan had included at least one day at the Boston Corporate Office.  Nevertheless, Gerry had difficulty fitting us in at the office.  Our lack of construction experience prevented us from performing certain tasks without some added guidance.  During our project, we learned that we are able to make good decisions when left to our own devices.  For the most part, the site supervisors gave us a task and sent us on our way.  Occasionally, we encountered obstacles and had to rely on our instincts to lead us in the right direction.  We often doubted ourselves, only to find that we were performing the task correctly.  We left the project with a newfound confidence in our own decision-making skills.Had we been able to spend a day at the Boston Office this experience would have been more rewarding.  We would have been able to take a look at the inner workings of a non-profit organization.  We would recommend this project to up-and-coming seniors.  It’s a rewarding experience as you get to give back to your community and develop useful skills.  We would however recommend that this project be done with a partner as some of the tasks can be monotonous. We were grateful for this experience.   </p>');

I knew this was an opportunity that many kids my age would’ve been overly excited about. However, although I saw it as a great chance to make connections, the job/field carried with it no particular interest for me. Because of this it turned out to be somewhat of a blessing in disguise when I was assigned to tutor at BTA for my project. I am not quite sure what career path I want to pursue, but teaching is definitely one option I look to explore. This project was exciting for me because I knew I would experience school through the eyes of a teacher rather than through those a student. Despite inheriting a relative position of power at BTA I was hesitant about asserting my authority over the students I tutored. Fresh off being a student myself, I was able to empathize with the early morning Monday doldrums or the exuberance associated with the waning minutes of a Friday school day. My first week or so, I would say this empathy overpowered my ability to discipline. If the kids got a little too talkative I was reluctant to tell them to address them. I was pleasantly surprised at how I was able to find a way to speak to my students when they were becoming a little too rambunctious and effectively calm them down. Being a disciplinarian was one challenge I knew I would struggle with entering this project, and I did struggle with it. But it was extremely beneficial to me as someone potentially looking to be a teacher to get experience dealing with kids in a classroom setting. Before taking on this project I didn’t know if I could command the attention of a classroom of students effectively. After spending about a month at BTA I learned that one of the only ways to know for sure that you can’t do something is to actually try doing it. Having the attention of fifteen students solely on me was definitely outside my comfort zone before this project. Having now completed this project I now know that I can do this somewhat comfortably and reasonably effectively. This project provided me with some great experience in a field I possibly want to pursue. It would have been nice to have another R.L. kid there with me just to so I could have been a little more comfortable to start, so if someone was looking to do this project again I would recommend possibly recruiting a partner-in-crime. I would definitely recommend this project to anyone who is interested in teaching, likes working with kids, or even someone who is stuck as to what project he should do. This is a great project for learning a lot about you as a person and getting some great experience in the work world.</p>');

The most rewarding thing about this project was seeing the end results. Holding a complicated set of earrings or a wonderfully elaborate pendant in my hands and knowing that I had a major part in creating it was extremely rewarding and made the entire project more than worth it. The most challenging part of the project however was the process through which I had to go to get to that end result. Patience is the best virtue when it comes to making filigree. The tiny wire coils have a tendency to pop out of the metal casts as one tries to keep them in place, and there were absolutely some frustrating moments of resignation when everything I had done for 20 minutes suddenly springs out and eradicates itself, forcing me to start over. One of the reasons I took up this ISP is because I knew how important patience would be during it, and I knew how impatient I can often be. I wanted to challenge myself with an art form that requires extreme patience and I think I was all the better for it. I certainly learned that despite the fact that I am perhaps not as innately patient as my grandfather, with enough determination and stubbornness I was able to overcome certain anxiety with the project and mature as a person. I think if the project were a little bit longer, it would have been more rewarding. I’m not sure if that speaks to me personally, but rather to the nature of my project itself; the procedures and actual mechanics of filigree are in fact fairly simple and I was able to pick up a cursory dexterity with them after the first week or so. However, I was still eons behind my grandfather, because this art, like any, really, is one that requires decades of experience to master. Since all I had was a five-week crash-course with the project, I wasn’t able to master one or two things as well as I would have liked. I’m grateful for the time I got to do the project in the first place however, as it was an extremely rewarding experience. Along the same vein, I would definitely recommend this project, or at the very least one of its kind to future seniors. I think working with a family member provided a relaxed environment where I could take risks more easily and have no fear of being embarrassed in front of my instructor. I also found that I learned a lot about my grandfather that I did not know until I did the project. I would also recommend the project because it was one where I was able to produce some sort of tangible evidence of my work, which is very satisfying.</p>');

Outside of loving my yuppie lifestyle, there was a great deal to enjoy in the office. Learning about the workings of the markets proved to be the greatest take away from my senior project. Coming in with no financial or economical experience, it proved to be extremely interesting to get even a brief overview of how the stock market works. With so many variables, so many moving parts, and so much luck involved, my boss described it best at just calling it a big casino. There were, however, some parts of the job that were not quite as exciting. Having to open and file nearly a thousand trade confirmations wasn’t exactly something I looked forward to every day. Furthermore, one of my most time consuming jobs was stuffing the envelopes for the company’s quarterly earnings report. This consisted of sitting at a table for basically the entire day, putting a binder in an envelope, stamping it, labeling it, and bringing it to the post office. Those are the days I do not soon wish to repeat. Looking back on it, there’s still a lot to take away from this project. Most notably would be that I want nothing to do with finance. The job is too time consuming, too volatile, and too grueling for me to want any part of. There’s very little that could’ve been done to the project to make it much more enjoyable. Obviously I wish there could’ve been more hands on tasks and more I could do directly relating to the market, however, that’s clearly unrealistic with my skill set. In sum, I would not recommend this project to another student. There are many other projects that would be much more hands on and more inclusive that could produce that much better of an experience. That being said, I am very happy with my time spent at North Bay Capital.</p>');

Before this project, I had as little an idea as to what a business plan was as anyone, and couldn’t even begin to imagine the many difficulties that would be involved with actually creating a summer camp. I actually did not even plan on doing this as my project at the start of the ISP process: I had something completely different in mind. I was originally going to work with special needs kids at an elementary school in Randolph, and the ISP committee thought it was a great idea and approved my proposal. However, Mr. Thornton and Dr. Stevens soon approached me and told me that they had an alternate idea for an ISP that they thought I ought to consider. They in no way, shape, or form forced me to change my ISP; rather, they provided me with the opportunity to work with a current Roxbury Latin alumnus and to help him write the business plan for the summer camp he was hoping to create. As much as I was looking forward to working with the special needs kids, I saw this new ISP proposal as an opportunity that I could not refuse, and took it upon myself to dive into this intimidating and complex ISP. On a day to day basis, my activities were pretty limited and dull: most of it involved me sitting in front of a computer for many hours doing research. However, it wasn’t as boring as it may sound.

I would certainly say that the most challenging part of my project was all of the research that I had to do. Sure, I would have enjoyed being able to do a couple more “active” things during my day, but in the end all of the hard work that I put in was certainly more than rewarding. Nothing was better than seeing my four weeks of work come together in one presentation, and then having the opportunity to present all of my work to Mr. Brennan and the Board of Trustees. I learned that I can buckle down and really push myself towards finishing a goal that in the beginning seemed nothing short of impossible, and that I might actually be able to survive out in the real world doing “adult” jobs. I would certainly recommend this ISP to anyone who might get such an opportunity as I did, although I’m sure it’s not every day that the ISP committee is provided with such an amazing opportunity. All in all I really enjoyed myself in this project, and am really proud of myself for everything I was able to accomplish.</p>');

I had a variety of tasks to accomplish, ranging from working directly with the kids on important academic skills to manning the library so the students could reach their 20-book requirement. I also did a fair amount of busywork; the school was doing a fundraising mailing, so there were a whole lot of envelopes to be labeled, stuffed, and stamped. The best part of my job was working with the kids, and the worst part was the office chores.</p>','<p>I entered the spring of my senior year not knowing exactly what I wanted to do with my ISP. I"d had some pretty grand aspirations earlier in my career at RL, but I knew I would have a tough practice schedule so I wanted to keep it simple. I knew I didn"t want to work at a law firm or big office. My proposals for a sleep study and an intensive study of how to talk to girls were both shot down. Epiphany was the answer. My actual duties at Epiphany were pretty light. The first few days, I had the opportunity to tutor kids in reading comprehension in preparation for a big battery of standardized tests. That was a challenge - the boy I worked with had some deficits in concentration - but it was also the most rewarding part of my time at Epiphany. Do not, under any circumstance, admit that you are capable of arranging labels in alphabetical order. I spent much of the rest of my time applying address label to thousands of envelopes. I also reorganized the non-fiction section of the library, checked books in and out for the kids, and helped develop the summer reading list in conjunction with Ms. Sherley Smith. Overall, I would recommend this ISP with one condition. Make sure you have a clear plan for your time at the school way before your first day. Otherwise you"re bound to get stuck with busywork. Working with the kids is a lot of fun, even if you"re not interested in education as a career. It was eye-opening to see first-hand the impediments that many of these kids have had to overcome.</p>');

Finally, I was asked to perform an array of lab procedures, being trained in the art of coaxing cells to grow in appropriate media and also being involved in designing and running a series of PCRs (polymerase chain reactions). The most challenging aspect of this project was the steepness of the initial learning curve, especially when it came to the biological jargon and procedural steps involved in experimentation. Oftentimes during team meetings, Dr. Arnaout would plan out some future steps that, although simple to understand for those who had been in a lab environment before, went completely over my head. Similarly, when reading “basic” review papers on a topic, I would be able to follow the terminology only up until the introduction. After that, I would have to repeatedly consult a textbook, and if the paper was a newer one (say, within the last 5 years), some terminology could not even be found in the textbook and had actually been derived from peer research. No doubt this research was familiar to the two Ph.D"s in the laboratory, but at some point, I had to give up on the vocabulary and be strung on by a general conceptual understanding of what was being discussed (most of the time, however, this would suffice in terms of the knowledge that was functionally necessary for my work). On the computer programming side, although I had done some earlier work in a physics/robotics background with C, learning the Python programming language was a different beast altogether. Although some terminology and practices were common to both languages, I had to spend some time in a “tutorial” phase before attacking the data analysis problems with the full required force.</p><p>The most rewarding parts of the project were the feelings of ownership and independence during the process of working on each individual project, combined with the pride felt upon completion. Considering my limited experience in a biological lab and the fact that I had never worked in a bioinformatics environment before, I envisioned early on that the project would be tutorial-like, as I shadowed more experienced personnel as they performed rote tasks. My actual time at the lab could not have been further from that vision. My supervisors allowed me a couple of hours to get the biological or programming basics, but then quickly threw me into a sink-or-swim programming problem or asked for a reaction design. At first, the freedom given to me and the creativity required for these tasks was stunning, but as the weeks progressed, I began to realize that I had been given only that knowledge which was functionally required for my job, and I cherished working collaboratively while also providing my own insights and asking questions when needed. By the project"s end, the programs which I produced and the analytical tools which I employed would have seemed unattainable for the Akshat of four weeks ago, and having a clear marker of how high my potential can be, even with a limited amount of time, has been the greatest revelation to me about myself. I would not recommend this project to students who want a slow-placed ISP. However, if a student wishes to combine deliberate individual creativity with a fast, collaborative working environment that is steeped in advanced academics, this project is perfect. Students oriented towards math, biology, and computers will probably enjoy this the most, but even academically advanced students who cannot function unless they have complete control of a situation should look elsewhere. Anyone who signs up for this project should know that, surrounded by the level of expertise present at the lab, he will be tossed around in the winds of relative ignorance. If someone can deal with that level of discomfort and remain excited enough to contribute positively to a team while making decisions on the fly, then he is the man for this job.</p>');

I also cleaned and put in order the rooms after the experiment was finished. This project was well suited for me as I know I want to go into medicine and I was able to get a accurate glimpse into the experimental side of that world. I was able to get extensive hands-on experience andnot simply watch other people conduct the experiments. Having access to this and the wealth of knowledge and experience of the Researchers ,Veterinarians and Physicians in the lab, has meant that I have been able to both complement the science courses I had taken at RL, but also build on this to get a better understanding of the application of knowledge acquired in Chemistry and Biology. It was not only technically challenging to conduct the experiment myself and still I feel as though I am a real  novice at the techniques I am using, but also rather frustrating with all the waiting and wading through paperwork to get anything done, which in itself has been a useful experience. One way in which I could have avoided some of the delays and annoyances is to have tried to do some of that before I got there, but even that would have proven difficult because of the specific clearance required to be involved with any research protocol and need to be on-site.  I have also had todeal with the ethical issues associated with the work I am doing. I have rationalized the use animals in this research because the development of the treatments would not be possible or safe for human use unless tested firstly on animals. I have also witnessed the care and compassion afforded to the animals by the researchers. This research is directly resulting in lives being saved on battlefields in foreign wars and is being used by medical services across the globe. So, although sadly animals’ lives are sacrificed, there is an enormous gain for the human population. I would not particularly recommend this project for another RL senior in the future as the nature of the work in the lab requires a great deal of time and dedication and as the ISP only lasts only a few weeks that does not allow enough time to complete a useful section of work. Anyone who played a sport would be unable to commit enough time to be involved in this work. It has been particularly difficult to take days out ot return to school as this has often been at an inconvenient time. However, I have really enjoyed the work and the team has been incredibly welcoming and generous to me. I am therefore continuing through the summer to complete the project and look forward to a continued involvement in the lab. </p>');

Then we were just a burned DVD away from a finished product. We said numerous times throughout the process that we had chosen, without a doubt, the best ISP. No offense to any of our classmates and the awesome opportunities they took full advantage of during this period, but creating a short film from scratch gave us everything that we could have wanted in an independent project. One hundred percent creative freedom – tempered with an inkling to avoid chase scenes, explosions, and the like – allowed us to explore a type of work rather unfamiliar in a typical high school. Not to mention we fashioned our own schedules. Often classmates would gripe about their boss or hours, to which I’d smugly reply, “Yeah my boss is a pretty freaking chill guy,” as I emphatically pointed at myself. And yet, just about everything about the project posed a challenge. Neither of us had ever taken a serious photo, let alone directed a scene. The creative process took maybe too much time to get going once the project had started. We would have been better served if we had had a more concrete idea of our plan at the get go. Not that we went in blind or baffled. We were aware of the difficulties that lay ahead in short shooting windows and endless editing room sessions. A few unexpected speed bumps applied no little stress. But, we survived, because we had to, because we were “independent” filmmakers. Nobody could be held accountable but us. What did I learn about myself? I can be fairly creative, both in collaboration and so independently I only make sense to myself. I developed an interest in Reggae/Dancehall music while listening to WERS 88.9’s “Rockers” and WUMD 89.3’s “Roots Radical Connection” during much time spent behind the wheel or in the passenger seat. I learned I can be calm and even chipper under pressure. Most tangibly, I cultivated an interest in filmmaking never considered before. While I’m not sure I’ll keep it up in college, Matt and I certainly plan to film some more cinematic gold this summer. And this time we’ll remember to charge the battery… I would highly recommend a project of this nature to any pair of students considering doing something creative. While ISPs are a unique opportunity in themselves, making a short film is an opportunity that I would likely never have had. And I relished every moment. However, it is absolutely not for the faint of heart. Expect to pull an all-nighter or two. Expect to face significant setbacks. Remember Murphy’s Law. And seriously, remember to charge the battery.</p>');

We began our project by emailing a list of veteran alumni requesting information about their terms of service.  Our plan was to create an honor wall, similar to those at national monuments, and use the information we received to create a book with profiles of each veteran.  We asked veterans for their highest rank achieved, conflicts served in, branch of service and other information of that type.  We were surprised by how quickly people responded - 12 responses within 48 hours - but were discouraged when responses slowly stopped coming in.  We combined this research with looking through the school archives and to find all veteran alumni.  We compiled a list of over 150 veterans.  The second portion of our project was to train Jay Shea, fitness trainer at APECS, in order to prepare for our own military service.  He focused on structural balance with us which will be key at the academies.  Because the military places a lot of emphasis on pushups, pull-ups, and sit-ups, a lot of soldiers have overly developed chests and arms while their backs, which support the body, are weak.  This makes them prone to back injury which prevents almost any type of physical activity, even simple tasks like bending over.  He also worked on building our mental toughness or as Rl calls it, "grit," so that we will be better prepared for the tedious regiments at West Point and Annapolis.</p>','<p>This project taught us a lot.  The "Man Challenges" taught us the importance of teamwork and motivation.  For example, during one of our many tests where we were carrying a log above our heads, the fear of letting down your partner kept you going past your limits, both physically and mentally.  We also learned how to scan through pages and pages of information and pick out the small tidbits that we were actually interested in.</p><p>We also realized how just because we were really interested in and excited by our project, other people don"t alwaYS care.  A mere 26 out of the 93 people we reached out to responded to the survey.  While many of the responses we got were very detailed and involved, others were very basic and didn"t even complete our entire questionnaire.  While the small number of responses were disheartening, we were energized and invigorated by the detailed responses.  In addition, there were a number of guys who kept tabs on us throughout the process because they were excited about our project.  This showed us how it is important to get other people involved and interested in your project, otherwise you begin to lose interest yourself.</p>');

I am currently helping develop the nutrition learning program as well as a supplementary application to manage the database of foods. For the main nutrition program, I needed to continue working with pre-existing code that provided a rough version of how the program should run. The supplementary application is a new idea and is being built up from scratch. Most days I worked at home planning and coding, but on certain days I met with my off-campus adviser, Walter Bender, the founder of Sugar Labs, to talk about my current progress as well as managing how I want to design the code. For the earlier part of the project, I focused on planning and just outlining what I wanted to improve on the pre-existing code. For the middle and later parts I focused more on the coding side, although planning for the new application is still in progress.</p>','<p>My internship at Sugar Labs provided me valuable experience with collaborative programming as well as the experience to work within a small software company. My past programming experience generally focused on my own coding: whether it be in APCS, in my programming tutorial, or in Botball, the work I have done has generally been written by me or has been heavily dictated by me. But for my work at Sugar Labs, I worked with pre-existing code, written by someone else, in a programming language I am not completely familiar with, in a different operating system, using unfamiliar software. I no longer had the freedom of having full control of a project, I was restricted with these somewhat unfamiliar electronic waters. It was necessary for me to keep almost daily communication with my off-campus adviser so I did not stray too far from the original code, and all my ideas needed to be run through him. Perhaps my biggest challenge was my own freedom. Since I worked from home, on my own computer, on my own time, getting distracted was easy. During the whole period I probably tried 5 different ways to get through my work for the day. Some methods worked, and some utterly failed, leading me to work late into the nights and sometimes the next day. So I found that I have a fairly low attention span and the patience to work for numerous hours at a time. What I found to work best for me was to have a small list of things I needed to get done that day. Not just a big picture, but smaller, more specific tasks. Coupling this with a work schedule I call work chunks. Generally an hour long I split my  day into chunks, each generally the same time, and each dedicated to one thing. I say that the chunks are flexible because I make it so that if I can work for more than an hour I can dedicate the next chunk with an equal or less amount of time. I essentially put a cap on my off-work time. I guess the only way to make the project more rewarding is if I had more time to work on the program. I don"t mean working on the project after its dedicated time, which I currently am doing. But I wish I had more time before the start date to get accustomed to what I was working with a bit more. I feel that too much of my project period was spent debugging problems with computers trying to set up a work environment for myself instead of actual coding. This is not to say that I wish I didn"t have that experience, debugging my problems actually gave me some general developer knowledge I never had. But with such limited time, I wish I spent my senior project actually developing the code. I would definitely suggest this project or a similar project to anyone who wants to be within the CS field. I would suggest preparing extensively, but the experience was much more rewarding than I thought it would be. You learn how to deal with other people"s code, learn how to manage your own time, and you get this experience you can put on your own resume.</p>');

Although many of my tasks sound tedious, I actually had a great deal of fun and enjoyed my entire experience there. The most important and interesting portion of my project did not occur when I was actually completing tasks. It was during downtime, or during the frequent loss of internet connection, when I was able to talk to people who have gone out and experience the real world, away from the secluded bubble of an academic institution. This was chatting with the paid staffers, anyone from the highest ranking campaign manager to the head of maintenance and security, or even one of the many college interns that were around. From them, I was able to gather some insight on this career choice that will help guide my decisions in the future. It was not easy integrating myself into this environment at first. The office life is much different than a structured school day. There is more independence, less mandatory work, and too many strangers that you just do not know. I struggled at first with my comfort level around the staffers, not knowing whether cracking a joke would be frowned upon and also not knowing what I could or should be doing. Yet, as a couple days went by I slowly eased my way into my own niche and felt as if I had been with the campaign from the start. I proactively sought out tasks to do so I always was, or seemed to be, busy. This project gave me a taste of what it was like working in the real world, beyond the confines of our little nursery. I learned that I absolutely hate mind numbing tasks. They can sometimes be deceivingly difficult, but are part of the learning curve for all interns, no matter where you work. By following the more experienced staffers lead, I learned how to balance out work and also socializing around the office. There were many great stories told in between making phone calls and writing the next “letter to the editor”. Finally, I learned that I did in fact enjoy a lot of the work in the office and would definitely like to do something of this manner in the future. One big problem with my and with the ISPs in general is the amount of time we have to do them. I do not mean the month long duration but rather the hours you can put in each day. There is not really a way to fix this, but having to cut your day off early to get back to school for sports limited the opportunities I had to attend events outside the office like fundraisers and press conferences that I had been invited to by my off campus advisor. Since I am also thinking of helping with the campaign for part of the summer, I hope to be able to catch some of these events then. This is a project that I would absolutely recommend to others. I enjoyed this month immensely as I did not have to do all too strenuous work but did in fact learn a lot about the process and career choice behind campaigning and politics. I had a very rewarding last month of senior year that definitely did not go to waste. </p>');

I had attended Nativity before attending RL. The daily routine would start early in the morning at 7:55. At 8:05, the school gathers in the upstairs chapel for assembly. Assembly consists of an attendance road call, announcements, and prayer. I would then do any miscellaneous task that teachers had for me. This includes grading quizzes and test, setting up a classroom, or helping out a student with a difficult Algebra equation.  This was followed by morning recess, which I would proctor in the gym. Sometimes I would even play a little with the kids. After morning recess, I would work with the 5th grade on their science fair projects. After this, another recess would come and go. The afternoons were very light. They usually consisted of making photocopies or some chitchat with my off campus advisor.</p>','<p>Working at Nativity Prep is an experience I will never forget.

The kid working in the basement (prep) usually cut onions, washed parsley, peeled carrots, and did other “small” tasks (although in a large quantities). At the end of the lunch shift, we would both change and eat staff lunch with the other Sweet Basil employees. </p>','<p>My ISP experience at Sweet Basil was a rewarding one. I set out to learn how to be a cook, and while I don’t think I entirely achieved that goal, I did learn a good amount about the restaurant business and its various working components, along with, of course, some of the skills I initially hoped I might attain. The first two weeks I spent upstairs on the line, mostly setting up for the day’s work and then tossing salads and making fries and chicken parms, the most basic of the hot food. When it got busy, Tony sent me to the dishroom to get some pans and plates clean before we ran out. So, while a good amount of time was spent performing rather mundane tasks, like washing dishes and lugging large amounts of food around, I did get some valuable time making food, and so I learned some important skills. Downstairs, similarly, some time was spent on mundane tasks, like breaking down boxes and tossing them in the dumpster, or putting away the large loads of produce the restaurant received daily. However, my knife skills increased substantially due to all the time I spent cutting mushrooms and onions, fulfilling my starting expectations for the project. The challenging aspects of the mundane tasks were balanced nicely by the rewards of the more enjoyable parts of the job. Dave Becker, the owner, expected us to realize that we didn’t want to be cooks a couple weeks in, and to a certain extent I think that may be true. My initial goal was to learn how to cook, not necessarily to want to be a cook, though. However, the project was still a rewarding experience, with the knowledge and expertise I gained in the four weeks spent at Sweet Basil. I would recommend the project to anyone with a desire to experience cooking firsthand, though more to people who may want to be a part of a restaurant and less to those who just want to learn how to cook.</p>');

We tried to convince people that were totally uninterested in what we had to say to sing our papers, just so we could escape the blistering sun.  Although we did many different things and talked to many different people, I have only truly learned two things from this ISP. I learned that patience is one of the most important virtues a political campaign volunteer can have. I also learned that no campaign would even get off the ground without the people that do what I did.

After meeting with the various people working in the office for about 15 minutes, we would head out for our day’s activity. No matter what activity we were doing that day, it required me to interact with a random person who, for the most part, had no interest in talking to me. Whether I was asking them to sign a petition or simply inquiring about whom they would be voting for in the upcoming election, people’s reaction would always be different. For me these social interactions were the most challenging and at the same time most rewarding. No matter what the interaction was, I learned something from it. I definitely refined my approach when talking to people over the course of the project. Also as cliché as it sounds, I learned a powerful lesson to not judge anyone by looks. Many times over the course of the project I had quite positive experiences talking with people whom I would not have, if I was not looking for their signature. I also learned that politics is not a field that I would like to enter as it stands right now. I think the project could have been more rewarding if I had an even deeper look into the campaign in order to learn more about the political process. I do believe I learned a lot about the process, but there were definitely a lot of things I missed out on.

This website provides a free service to people allowing them to delve deeper past the radio into the realm of music and culture. Featuring album/mixtape streams, downloads, and reviews, the goal of this website is to provide for people a look at good music today. The radio doesn’t really have a lot of what on here because not all of these artists can pay for radio time. Also I believe this site allows for a more intimate interaction with artists because I also post interviews and news. On top of the music there are also links to different websites, videos, art, and pictures that are inspirational or just downright interesting. Its been a pleasure putting this together and I look forward to continuing with it, because for me it is more than just an ISP its become a hobby. </p>','<p>My Day to day was actually great. I had a lot of free time, which was sometimes difficult to manage. On average I would wake up and decide exactly what I wanted to fix or create on the site. After talking with Mr. Hiatt and my off campus advisor Mr. Henry, I learned that a lot of this is trial and error. Sometimes it will take an hour just to move one thing 3 inches to the left or right, or get the video to play in the right space.  The initial set up of the menus was the hardest I think that took about a week to do. It was hard to decide A. the look and B. the feel of it. A lot of the time spent was actually just me being very picky aesthetically. The drop down menus were really difficult because sometimes they would work and sometimes they wouldn’t. Eventually we figured out they seemed to work more often once they had some content in them. Still they only worked about 70% of the time. It took a little bit of tinkering with the code to figure it out but eventually we got the desired result. For me this was the most difficult part of the project besides time management. The fact that sometimes I spend hours doing something only to have it not work was sometimes a huge setback, but I’ve learned some real resilience. One of the most rewarding things about this ISP was I had a lot of free time, and doing a project that revolves around art and culture I took upon my self to read about and listen to a LOT of music and art. It’s actually the first time I’ve pleasure read since I’ve been at RL. One of my favorite books I read was Places And Spaces I’ve Been by Pharrell Williams. It almost served as my touchstone for innovation and creation. Whenever I was out of ideas or looking for a new artist to spotlight or look into I would always get good ideas after 15 minutes spent in that book. There’s interviews in there with the likes of Jay-z and Kanye west, but the ones that really get you are the ones with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, or a movie orchestra conductor Pharrell worked with. It’s interesting to see art and intelligence transcend genre and occupation. One important thing I learned about myself is that I really don’t like being held to a schedule, however I wouldn’t have survived without a daily routine.  Of waking up, showering, breakfast, ISP work for 2 hours, break, back to work, go for a run, eat again, and go back to work. I would recommend this project only if you have a true passion for what it is your trying to do because the amount of free time may lead you astray, HTML is not an easy thing to use and building a website is no small task. However this was a great project and I wouldn’t of rather done it any other way. </p>');

He would also, on the same day, perform PRP (platelet-rich plasma) transfusions into the heel/foot to help heel harmed soft tissue. This experience was very rewarding. Dr. Theodore was extremely hospitable during my month shadowing him. He let me follow him everywhere – surgery, clinical visits, and other smaller procedures. Because of this, I believe that I got a true look at the day-to-day operations of an upper-echelon surgeon. There were several aspects of his job that I found appealing. First of all, his occupation is concerned with helping other and all types of people: from regular folks like us, to sports stars Julian Edelman and Andrew Ference, who stopped by during my month there. Dr. Theodore has also worked with David Ortiz, Tom Brady, and Curt Schilling, among other superstars. It is his sole responsibility to help patients figure out how they can best lead their lives given their injury or lingering condition. Another rewarding aspect of this career path is that you are dealing with new patients who pose new problems to you.  Each day provides a new challenge for you so that you don’t feel like you are going through an endless routine. I came in each day to the office exited to see what new cases I would be able to observe. Medicine and health care offer copious fields of specialization as well, so that even if orthopedics were not for me, there are numerous other fields that I could look into. My ISP was not challenging, per se. I was simply observing Dr. Theodore and did not have to accomplish a goal. So, instead, I can talk about the challenges that Dr. Theodore faces. For one, becoming a doctor, especially one as highly regarded as he, takes hard work and dedication. With many students striving to become doctors, you have to study extremely hard to study and stand out for hiring hospitals and so that you can be an effective doctor as well. Also, you have to deal with people who ignore your recommendations, which can be frustrating as a doctor helping you try to heal. If there were one challenging aspect of this ISP, it would have been waking up early. In order to be at his office at 8:00, I would have to wake up at 6:30, which, for Senior Spring, is quite early. After this month, I think that going into medicine is a strong possibility for me. It combines my desire to help other people with constant intellectual stimulation. I am not completely sure that I am going into medicine, but this ISP has definitely pushed the odds towards it. I wish that we did not have to come into school so much during these twenty days of ISP. I had to miss a few days of OR time because of mandatory class meetings that, in my mind, were not completely necessary. Since twenty days is a short time for a meaningful experience in the first place, each and every day is crucial for a rewarding experience. I would strongly recommend this project to anyone who is interested in a serious ISP, especially those interested in medicine. Opportunities like this one don’t usually come around for high school students, and we at RL have to realize how lucky we are to have these types of connections. </p>');

The most rewarding part of my project was the knowledge that what I was doing was actually going to be used, and, in fact, the information I had compiled on my spreadsheet was like gold to many people, who sincerely appreciate my efforts. In addition, just looking at the documents I created after I finished them gave me a great feeling, as I could tangibly see the results of the large amount of work I had done over the four weeks.  The most challenging part of the project was the lack of clear guidelines for me. Much of what I was doing had never been done by someone else before, and even if it had, there was no set of directions I could follow. Mr. Katz would often say, “Figure this out for me,” and that was all I got for a sense of direction.  I learned that I have the ability to think outside the box and to create something from nothing. In addition, I learned that I am very detailed and when I put myself up to doing a task, I do not want to do half the work or not put all my effort into it. I want to complete it to the best of my ability and be proud of what I have done. I also learned that I really do not want a desk job or a paperwork job when I get older, as I did get bored and distracted at times.  I believe if I had started on the school information for Mr. Thornton at first, and had a chance to present the spreadsheet I created to Mr. Berman, the founder of i2 Camp, among others, then I would have had the reward of seeing the people for whom I was working, and actually seeing their, hopefully positive, reaction to my work.  I don’t know what this project would look like in the future, as much of what I have done is one-time work, however, if there were similar work for a project then I would definitely recommend what I was doing for Mr. Thornton, although my work for Mr. Katz was not as enjoyable and I would not highly recommend it, unless you want to get a sense of what busy work feels like. </p>');

The Rock Spot in Dorchester served as home base for the climbing portion of my ISP. At the gym, I would work on my climbing technique by myself. I would not only top rope, but would boulder as well. At Hale Reservation, I would do whatever work they needed me to do. All of it would be outdoors, which allowed me to enjoy the beautiful weather we had every day of my ISP. Finally, during the extra time I had, I would go outdoors and do a different activity. I fished, hiked, longboarded, kayaked and canoed. I was very fortunate to be able to spend so much time outdoors, and learned all of the basics of rock climbing that I will need to know if I want to start climbing outdoors.</p>','<p>I started my ISP with high hopes for what I would be able to accomplish. The Rock Gym was a great place for me to start trying out rock climbing. I quickly realized how great a workout climbing was; my forearms were never as sore as they were after my first day. After three tiring days at the gym, I realized that I needed something else to fill up my time. Dr. Stevens recommended volunteering at Hale Reservation, which turned out to be perfect. I was able to make my own schedule, and coordinated it in a way that allowed me to not only have time to go to the Rock Gym, but also allowed me to have enough time to go outdoors and enjoy myself. During the second week of my ISP, I took a nasty fall off the bouldering area at the gym. I was kinda shaken up, and took a break from climbing for a bit. I went and hiked around at Blue Hills, near the skiing area, and wandered around Hale Reservation. I never knew how large that area was until I got incredibly lost one afternoon. As my ISP went on, I found the perfect balance between helping out at Hale, climbing at the rock gym, and spending time outdoors. I went fishing a lot, and tried to teach myself how to fly fish. I explored the Arnold Arboretum on my longboard, enjoying the many different hills that are so perfect for thrill seeking idiots like myself. I went kayaking and canoeing on the Charles, and was even able to catch some fish in the dirtiest river out there. Although my ISP started out as rock climbing, it became a lot more than just that. I fell in love with rock-climbing, even though I never really got outside to do an actual climb; I signed up for some classes, but they all got rained out. When I went up north to take a course last weekend that got rained out as well. In fact, it snowed on Saturday night. I was not about to go out and try to climb something solo; the rock gym has a pad that breaks your fall if you slip up, but there is nothing like that out in the wild. I am fortunate to now have the skills needed to begin rock climbing more seriously. I will certainly continue to climb in the future. If I had actually taken classes for rock climbing, my ISP would have run more smoothly. However, I enjoyed learning everything by myself, because it forced me to figure everything out without someone helping me. I learned the hard way why you don’t try and grab a handhold that you haven’t tested while climbing. I learned that raking is dangerous work, and that snakes don’t tend to do very well when they come up against a weed whacker. I would recommend this project to anyone who loves the outdoors. I spent so much time outdoors, and never had a moment when I was bored or tired of what I was doing. If anybody is interested in spending time outside, getting involved in a new outdoor activity, and loving every second of their 5 week ISP, this ISP is perfect for them.  </p>');

To be able to work with this revolutionary technology was an incredible experience. The sense of pride and satisfaction I got every time an object that I designed came out clean was more than enough to validate the ridiculous amount of time and effort spent making the design. This project also meant a lot to me because I was so invested personally. I found the challenges of computer design intriguing and engaging. Being able to see a physical product of your creativity makes the exercise much more involved. And I learned that when I have that personal investment I am more than willing put in great effort to get the job done.  I do wish I had begun learning the design aspects of the project much earlier. More than half of our time during the project was spent on learning the challenging methods of CAD design. If I had been more proficient earlier on I think my final products now could have been much higher quality.  I absolutely would recommend this project to future seniors. I think that 3D printing can become and integral part of the RL curriculum, but it needs more time and people who are invested in its use.</p>');

We looked at retail industries, and then specific companies in each industry, and made judgments over just how well-suited each was to survive the digitization of consumption. The most rewarding aspect of the project was the organic, original analysis that Anu and I achieved by the end of the project. The decisions that we ultimately made about the welfare of companies and industries did not arise out of the someone else’s research and conclusions; rather, we constructed our own research tool in the survey and implemented our own data into our conclusions. To me, this originality of thought gave substantially more weight to our judgment. What’s more, the project in essence taught me about the process of exploring a real-world issue in depth. It revealed that there is a large amount of work that goes behind formulating a solid thesis, and that pre-conceived notions about the way that people behave aren’t always correct. I learned that undertaking my own research can yield results as useful as any massive experiment or survey, and that complex financial analysis most of the time derives from simple, understandable guiding principles. Mr. Maffie’s guidance made the world of business, and retail specifically, much less of a foreign concept. The project, simply put, was a successful first experiment in independent analysis. I found the single most challenging aspect of the project to be travel, and especially working around my schedule with lacrosse and school. Without parking at the office, I had to figure out alternative ways to get to and from the project, whether that meant riding in with my dad, or driving to West Roxbury and taking the commuter rail, or even taking the subway from Braintree. Ultimately, I would spend upwards of two and a half hours in commute each day, which I believe really detracted from the thoroughness of the project. Most days, in order to arrive at practice on time and fulfill my duties as captain of the lacrosse team, I’d have to leave the office just after lunchtime. This created difficulty for Anu and I as we tried to sync up our schedules and collaborate successfully. Another challenge in the project was properly designing the survey so that the results were tailored to the original question that Mr. Maffie posed to us. We had to get in touch with SurveyMonkey multiple times because of inadequate response or technical issues with regard to the survey design. I would strongly recommend the project to any student interested in economic analysis and finance. The work is productive and engaging, the hours are flexible, and the people at Adage are gracious and supportive. The result is a productive project that comes from the student, not the adviser or the company or the School. My time at Adage has taught me several invaluable lessons that extend beyond the world of stocks and markets; it has demonstrated to me the way that a firm of the highest degree operates, and has instilled in me important principles about the way to go about business professionally, no matter the field that I end up in.</p>');

This court is only available for veterans with substance abuse and/or mental health histories, and takes a longer term approach (about 2 years) to punish defendants for their crimes while also getting the vets the treatment they need to stay crime-free afterwards. Most of my research involved statistics about the veterans who come in and the effectiveness of the program in lowering recidivism and addiction. For example, by showing that the average age of an incoming defendant was far higher than the average age of military deployment of the defendants, we were able to justify the court’s assertion that the veterans’ mental health/substance abuse/criminal problems mostly started after (and by implication, as a result of) their military service, speaking to the nature of the court’s jurisdiction to treat veterans specifically. I also created a computer spreadsheet system which can be used to continually track this (and 17 other) data points into the future. I definitely feel that I got a lot out of my ISP. I had been interested in law as an academicfocus, but was unsure if a career as a lawyer/judge would interest me as well. By seeing theday-to-day work of a judge and the court (including the prosecutors and defense attorneys), I was able to confirm that the legal career path is one I would enjoy pursuing. Additionally, an unexpectedly-rewarding aspect of my project was the work I did for the Veterans Treatment Court. It was a tangible accomplishment I can point to, and will help this fledgling program expand in the future (my research was already used in a statewide “Mental Health and the Law” conference).  None of the practical aspects of my project were overwhelmingly challenging. The courtstaff was very flexible with letting me stay more some days and miss others to accommodate school and other commitments, for example. And the court’s location halfway between my house and RL was very convenient, as I had to come back to RL almost every day betweenTech Week, Tripod Week, and class meetings.  The only thing I’d change about my project would be to have done it at an appeals court.  This is the area of law (constitutional and appeals) that specifically interests me the most, as opposed to the District Court criminal/civil level, so it may have been slightly more applicable to me. I tried to arrange this project at an appeals court, but was unable to.I would absolutely recommend this project, but only to a certain subset of RL kids. This is the type of project for which there is no middle ground. Law and shadowing a judge will either be a fantastic ISP choice (if you’re actually interested in it) or it will be terribly boring (if you only do it by default or because someone set it up for you).</p>');

Each week had an equal amount of recording, song and lyric writing, and producing. There were many rewarding parts of our project. I love making music, so having the opportunity to spend most of every day for a month working on music was immensely rewarding in and of itself. My collaboration with JB was terrific, and we really brought the best out of each other both in terms of generating creative ideas for songs, and in performing when recording. Hearing our final songs was also immensely rewarding, especially when compared to the original versions of each song that we wrote up. Our progression as artists and producers was huge – our later songs are much more polished and interesting and just better than our first efforts. Our primary difficulties were in the recording and editing processes. The music came really easy to us, but we didn’t know how to use the recording software, and there was a definite learning curve. We had to teach ourselves how to record, and how to use different editing techniques. As a result, some of our earlier songs are simpler and less inspired, sense the technical aspects of our project interfered with our ability to make our music. However, as we learned the program we were better able to pour our visions directly into the software, and produce records that sounded how we wanted. I learned a lot about collaboration, and the importance of knowing when to yield to others ideas when working on a group project. JB and I worked well together, but there were times when we had artistic differences to work through. I’m actually fairly astonished that our songs have as coherent a sound as they so, since JB and I were pulling them opposite directions much of the time. We overcame our differences, and learned to collaborate. I also learned how much a really love making music, writing and playing it, and how real studios use different editing tricks and musical techniques to create the sounds we know and love. This project would have been more rewarding if the recording and producing side of the project hadn’t interfered with our ability to make music. We should have learned how to use the software before we started the project, so that we could have bypassed a whole section of the learning curve and jumped straight to making good music. I’d definitely recommend this project to others, especially those who love music. I had a terrific time working on this project, and I learned a lot about music, especially music production, which I had never tried before.</p>');

First because of the roblem solving aspect of Computer science. There is great sense of satisfaction that I recieved from doing this project, However this did not just appear when we had completed the project but every little juncture that we crossed. When you finnally comlplete a functionality, unlike most other ISPs, you can see what you have achieved and it gives you a great sense of satisfaction. Andrew and I encountered many challenges while working on this project but we were able to conquer all but one. Possibly the greatest challenge that Andrew and I faced was the process of ending the game, making the game recognize checkmate. this may seem easy but when you try to tackle it you realize that you have to do way more than expected. Utimately this was the one aspect of chess that we did not accomplish in our game. However there were some challenges that we did overcome such as the clicking function of the game which allows that player to click a piece and then click a square and the piece will move there provided that it is a valid move. I learned in this ISP that I truelly have a talent and enjoy problem solving. Computer science rquires you to make the computer to do things using the most basic tools, So you are forced to design your programs with a great deal of creativity and ingenuity and working out how to achieve this is incredibly enjoyable. While I did enjoy this part of Computer Science I also reliazed that I dont want to make comuter scinece a profession. I came this conclusion because I find the grind of coding line after line incredibly frustrating and at times unbearable. Additionally learning java is very similar to learning a language and languages have always cause me a great deal of problems. I think this project could have been more rewarding if Andrew and I had decided on a project that fit better into gridworld. While gridworld is a nice platform to start a chess program it is no way designed to facilitate a game like chess. So I think a better base program may have made this program less frustrating allowing us to get more done and enjoy it much more. I would absolutely reccomend not just prgramming a game but programing in general. The projects can be extremely interesting and they allow you to have a great deal of freedome. Additonally having an end product trueally allows you to feel as though you have accomlished something over the past four weeks. Finnally programing almost always takes more time than expected so there is never a worry about whether this project is to short or not big enough. </p>');

In this project, I garnered valuable writing experience from having my writing published, and I also learned about advertising and other important facets of small town journalism. In addition, I met a lot of interesting people doing various interviews and improved my own communication skills.  The most rewarding thing about this project was seeing my writing being published in a real newspaper with a fairly large distribution. Working at such a small place was beneficial in that everything I did felt important, and that the newspaper really could benefit from what I was doing. From the instant I started working, I was doing real journalism, which likely would not have been true if I had interned at a larger newspaper.  The challenging thing about this project was managing the people around me and staying focused. Often, the other people in the office would be engaged in arguments right next to me and I would have to sit there and act like I didn’t notice they were happening. Another challenging thing was overcoming my dislike of bothering other people. In making advertising calls, or going out to try and find quotes, I was bound to annoy a few people, and I had to learn how to manage that. One thing I learned about myself is that I don’t feel comfortable making other people feeling uncomfortable. For instance, my first task was to call a Dedham official who was rumored to be resigning and ask him if he was indeed leaving. Thankfully, it went to voicemail, but doing things like that to try and find interesting stories and quotes was not my favorite part of the job. I also learned that I don’t want to feel isolated for very long. Doing some things on my own are fine, but when there isn’t anybody in the office I can talk to, the days begin to drag on. This project would have been more rewarding for me if my hours were not as strictly tied to 8:30-3 every day. For instance, if I had been able to come in later some days and work in the early evenings or nights, I could have covered more sporting events or other things around town. Journalism doesn’t necessarily happen during set hours of the day, so if my schedule had been more flexible, I think I could have eliminated some of the down time of the mid-mornings and been more helpful with covering nighttime events. I would recommend this project only if you knew exactly what you were getting into and simply wanted a chance to have your writing published. I would suggest meeting the people at The Dedham Times first, because they are a little eccentric and might rub you the wrong way. As long as you know who you are working with, and know that you will be extremely isolated in this job, it has its benefits. I learned a lot of invaluable information about the small town journalism industry that will come in handy as I think about journalism down the road.  Overall, this project had its highs and lows. I wish a couple things had been different, but for the most part, I was glad I got the chance to do real journalism and actively participate in what I was doing.</p>');

After watching many of Hales’ videos, I set out to take his philosophy and approach in a more serious direction; by filming an actor as he/she creates an unusual scenario for unsuspecting (but ultimately willing) strangers, I hoped to reveal a little bit about the “subjects’” psychological makeup. While the majority of LAHWF’s work is solely for comic effect, I wanted my short film to be both amusing and illuminating—specifically, I wanted to get a better idea of how we generally respond to strangers (or strange situations), and why we react the way we do. The major questions I explored with my ISP were as follows: How does your clothing affect the perception and trust of others? How does location affect people’s reaction to certain situations? (The wildcard question) How do people react to strange questions? On my journey to explore these questions, I needed to master the art of candid camera-style (hidden camera) filming and video editing on iMovie; my project’s final result was a short film/video collection that could best reveal the answers to the questions above.</p>','<p>In brief, the goal of my project was to explore the various elements that contribute to our judgment of strangers – and, consequently, how we will react to them in certain situations. To achieve this goal, I set out to catch particular “live” social experiments on camera and ultimately construct a coherent short film revealing my findings; above all else, this experiment was extremely fulfilling for me because I was able to achieve both of these goals within the four-week time period while also having a good deal of fun. I’m not suggesting, however, that my project was easy – it was actually quite the opposite. Here are just a few of the obstacles I faced along the way: equipment (microphone and computer) issues that pushed back my schedule a whole week, unreliable actors who were tough to manage schedule-wise and concentration-wise, and legal crackdown that made filming conspicuously in public extremely difficult (I lost a lot of good footage after a police officer told me I couldn’t film in the mall). Although my final product was only 15 minutes long, audio and video editing took even more time than I had anticipated—I must have dedicated at least 20 hours in the last two days to making sure the film ran smoothly.  Though of course very frustrating, all of these challenges were really what made my ISP so rewarding.   Equipment issues forced me to take matters into my own hands, to mold (and purchase) the tools necessary to fulfill my vision for the project; I could have given up after the first week, but I stayed the course and learned to embrace the near-absolute independence given to me to manage my project. The actors, however, forced me to learn the most valuable ability: that of truly directing, leading. Over the course of my project, I realized that I needed to strike a fine balance between work and play to keep my actors happy and at their best—even though I wanted to be productive with every shoot, that just wasn’t possible. Managing those who could both destroy and build the foundations of my project was the hardest and most rewarding aspect of my ISP.  My four weeks of work resulted in the following conclusions (which can be found in my final product as well):  Bostonians are generally rude and cynical toward strangers. Our age and gender (the fact that we were teenage males) seemed to affect people’s trust far more than our manner of dress.  People are often more open and trusting when in a group.  Location affects dramatically people’s attitude toward (physical contact with) strangers. Greed seems to be an inherent trait, not one necessarily impacted by one’s surroundings.  My journey to reach these conclusions was a difficult but fulfilling one; I would definitely recommend a project similar to mine to any future RL student looking to dive into film/entertainment while also having fun and learning some lessons along the way.</p>');

I drew inspiration from the Surrealist movement, trying to break from my typical realistic and representative style. I explored my imagination and blended my own work with elements or techniques learned from Surrealist artists. I think my project was rewarding in its balance of structure and independence. My work at the museum lent some rigidity to my schedule, while my independent drawing and painting allowed me some flexibility to work when I wanted. In addition, being surrounded by art and artistically minded people at work was inspiring and encouraging to my artistic endeavors in the studio. My independent work – drawing inspiration from Surrealism – was rewarding in that it exercised my more imaginative side. I developed some bizarre and interesting ideas that I didn’t know I could. At the museum, the most rewarding experience during my internship was definitely getting a tour of the art in the museum’s storage rooms. I got to browse the museum’s database of records and choose any pieces that I wanted to see. It was an incredible experience to observe such famous works so intimately. Additionally, I think the people at the museum are what made my time there worthwhile. They were all friendly, welcoming, and shared a common interest in art. They ensured that I had a variety of experiences to keep me occupied, interested, and feeling valued.  The most challenging part of my project was self-motivating during my time alone. Without a rigid schedule, it was difficult to decide where or when to begin drawing. I countered this by giving myself an assignment with every sketch I did – to study the works of a famous Surrealist and include some element of his work into my sketch, while developing a new subject matter of my own.  Although I had many unexpected firsthand run-ins with art at the museum, it would have been more rewarding to have seen more actual art throughout my time there. Seeing photos of the works isn’t the same as seeing the works themselves. However, since the museum was under construction, most of the pieces are locked away and not on display anywhere. So I consider myself very lucky to have had the chance to see some pieces in storage. Besides, I think the timing of my internship during the museum’s renovation allowed me to have a more behind-the-scene glimpse at museum work. I would definitely recommend this project to anyone interested in the arts, especially if they are concerned about their future. Meeting a lot of successful people at the museum who either went to art school or studied art history in college was encouraging to me, personally. It proved to me that a future in the arts is indeed possible, and made me accept and value my artistic interests more than I previously had. This was especially rewarding to me, and I think it would be necessary to anyone considering a future in the arts. </p>');

We started off the ISP drafting storyboards and finalizing a screenplay, which we then gave to our off­campus advisor, Mr. Michael Kilmurray (RL ‘95), to be formatted in the standard professional form (complete with all acting cues, dialogue, and prop/costume/character lists). In addition, Mr. Kilmurray equipped us with two shotgun microphones* to go along with the camcorder and microphone stand we had borrowed from Mr. Piper, making sure that we were ready to film as soon as possible. The acting was extremely enjoyable, although actors were sometimes difficult to organize, and the filming itself was rewarding (getting artistically pleasing shots, experimenting with different angles, etc.) but difficult, especially in scenes where both of our characters were needed. As our confidence with the equipment grew, we learned of ways to get around this problem, strategically placing microphones around the scene and enlisting the help of a friend or tripod to hold the camera. We then spent the majority of our time editing our project, working our way through our collection of many unusable takes to string together the best­looking scene, adding music to the soundtrack and adjusting audio levels/sound effects, and editing the footage itself in iMovie to add or change speeds, saturation levels, and credits. We are happy to say that our initial enthusiasm continued throughout the project, but we quickly learned that the crucial intricacies of film production are both abundant and very easy to overlook if there is any lack of meticulousness; the project was very useful in that it introduced us to the detailed world of behind­the­scenes media production while reminding us of the inherent limitations that lack of experience, connections, and funding in the industry impose.</p><p>*we experimented with another type of close­range vocal microphone as well, but the shotgun mics were far better at picking up general area sound as well as distinguishable dialogue.</p>','<p>This project was rewarding firstly because it allowed us to put our brains together creatively in a way we hadn’t really done before, drafting a storyline and script from scratch before the project even officially began. In a hands­on way, we experimented with themes and motifs of varying profundity, creating a movie where the decision one person has to make is illustrated in the differing attitudes and actions of two separate characters, where cigarettes serve as a simple symbol for the life of crime the main character is tempted to enter and a girl behind the counter represents an escape from that very same life. It was rewarding as well to get some experience with such a visual art form, seeing how some shots are more pleasing than others and experimenting with visual effects in post­film production. It was great to see our friends become enthused and inspired when called upon to serve as actors, and we even ended up with a very funny blooper reel to remind us of the good times we had during the project.  At the same time, however, this project presented some serious challenges to us, challenges which, in turn, made us more experienced and realistic about how much work is required to make a good movie. Our biggest challenge was finding sound equipment ­ Mr. Kilmurray generously allowed us to borrow shotgun mics from his job, but could only sign them out on certain days, which oftentimes frustrated us as his schedule would conflict with our planned shooting calendar. As mentioned in the abstract, we also faced the foreseeable problems of working with such a small film crew, and scenes in which both Harrison and I were needed had to be meticulously planned out and set up with a tripod and microphone stands, many times requiring re­shoots. Our actors, all of them working on their own senior projects, were very helpful but also very hard to coordinate, and we also had to film around the weather and other restrictions (Deno’s didn’t allow us to film the restaurant scene in their establishment, for example). The most important lesson I learned is to always be flexible and willing to do good work whenever possible. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project on a personal level, and even learned some things about myself along the way. I learned that hard work and short deadlines can produce some amazingly satisfying results, as Harrison and I would focus for hours to edit a whole scene or finalize a certain part of the script, but I also learned that creative differences can also lead to short tempers, and that a common belief in a final goal must overpower those differences. We still have one more scene to shoot, so I suppose more time would have made this project more rewarding to me. In every other way, however, I thought this project was perfect, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a story in their head that they want to see visualized. It is a very satisfying feeling to see a scene come together after hours of editing, or even to notice an accidental passerby which suddenly makes a shot much more interesting. It is also a project practically anyone can pursue ­ the software iMovie is surprisingly intuitive, and gives users a lot of possibilities to make their artistic vision exactly as they pictured it.</p>');

I am very interested in pursuing music further and embarking on a project that combined writing music with recording and producing it was very eye-opening.  It showed me not only the hard work it takes but also the fun and enjoyment that music can bring to me.  The hard work that this project required was very difficult at times.  The software we used had a very high learning curve.  It took us about two weeks to become very comfortable with the software.  We should have taken time before the project started to get to know the software we were using.  Also recording was pretty difficult because we didn’t have many effects at our disposal.  Auto-tune was non-existent so we had to sing and rerecord until the notes were exactly perfect.  I learned a few things about myself during this project.  First, collaboration can be very helpful in a music setting.  Having the ability to bounce ideas off of a partner can be important in determining the musical tastes of the people who will eventually listen to your music.  Also this project reinforced my love for music.  I wasn’t sure if music was something I wanted to seriously pursue after high school, but after completing this album I am sure that I want music to be a part of my life for years to come.  The project would have been more rewarding for me if we had taken the time to learn our software and equipment before the actual project time started.  Our last song was the best one we did, and if we had learned the software ahead of time, we could have made higher potential songs.  But this also means that I am eager to continue recording.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this project for an ISP.  If you are musically inclined, this is the perfect project for you because of the relaxed schedule.  You are free to set up your own timing and there is now company or specific hours to be constrained by.  If you’re wondering if music is something that interests you in the long run, this is the perfect project for you. </p>');

I found it very rewarding to make a large impact in the life of Khalil Fuller, the CEO of NBA Math Hoops. Khalil is a recent graduate of Brown University and was searching for a breakthrough in partnering with an NBA team after winning the MassChallenge- the world’s largest startup challenge- last year. After plenty of email exchange, when we finally met he was shocked to be working with someone younger than he. His excitement when the Celtics agreed to work with his product was contagious, and I’ve never been happier to know I helped start a hopefully long lasting relationship between this deserving young entrepreneur and the Boston Celtics.  The most challenging aspect of my project was the busy work that accompanied any important accomplishments. In order to help inside sales cut on their spending, I had to find and delete 12,000 non-functional phone numbers from their database. This menial job took two full days and there was no real personal award that I received when I finished it. When I talked to my off-campus advisor about it, he said that he would try to cut back on my busy work, but that it simulates the real world in that some of the biggest projects have the most boring behind the scenes work. This project affirmed for me my desire to enter the sports business field when I begin my working career. I’ve learned as a result of the meeting I participated in that business is a passion I want to pursue. For me there is nothing more exciting than watching two entities critically question each other until they can create a mutually beneficial plan. For me this project could have only been more rewarding if I had been more courageous to ask about switching to their Waltham offices, which align more with my business interests in sports agency. My off-campus advisor told me before my project began that this could be a potential option, but in the latter weeks of the project, I was too afraid to follow up on his offer. In Waltham I would’ve been able to sit in on NBA Draft interviews with NCAA athletes. I definitely would recommend this project. It was very rewarding for me as the projects and daily tasks I worked on all matched up with my personal interests. </p>');

We decided to build a one-seat Go Kart made out of a material called angle iron; we also decided not to weld anything on the Go Kart, since it would be costly and difficult to learn how to weld. We then built a basic rectangular frame, onto which we added, over the course of the ISP, the following: a steering system for the front two wheels, an engine mount on the back to which we attached a 6.5 horsepower engine, a seat and footboard for the comfort of the rider, a steering wheel/ Frisbee, a drive system made out of a clutch, chain, sprocket, axle, and back wheels, and acceleration and brake pedals wired to the engine and brake, respectively. Our project was extremely rewarding, despite- or perhaps because of- the fact that it was extremely challenging. The challenges were many. First, we simply did not have enough time to finish the Kart. ISP is 20 days long, but with time lost to AP tests, class meetings, and doctor’s appointments, we found ourselves in an extreme time crunch at the end. When you cut and drill through metal, you need to be precise, and precision takes time. The other and greater challenge was the constant string of engineering problems we faced. To build without welding, one must find clever ways to attach pieces together at the correct angle with enough stability. One engineering problem we faced was how to hold up our steering column in a way that would be solid enough to support its weight yet flexible enough to allow it to rotate with minimal friction; we solved this problem by drilling angled holes through wood blocks and building metal towers to hold the blocks at the correct heights. It’s extremely rewarding to solve problems like these, and most rewarding of all to look at the finished product, whether it is a small metal bracket with a hole drilled through it or a huge metal frame, and see a job well done. I think I know more about myself now than I did before the project. I knew I was persistent, but I didn’t know I could solve engineering problems in the real world. I’ve gotten practice at doing just that, and now I know I can. The project really met all my expectations, and then some; I think the one thing I’d change, to deal with the time crunch, would be to somehow plan it out and get all the parts over March break. I would definitely recommend this project. It was more work than most ISPs, but it never felt like work. I had a ton of fun- and now I have a go Kart!	</p>');

We would then leave each day to get back for sports, usually between 2pm and 3pm. This project was very rewarding because of all the invaluable information that I received. I am attending undergraduate business school next fall and before I went to go spend the next 4 years learning about business I wanted to first test it out for a month and make sure that this was a field that I wanted to go into. After my 4 weeks at Island Surf Company I can confidently say that this is a field that I would like to spend my life in. There is a thrill about some person wanting to buy your product because they like the quality of it, and this is a thrill I want to capture in the future. Another rewarding aspect of this project was the conversations that I had with Mike O’Brien about business and how to run a company. Whenever we went out to lunch Mike O’Brien would give Mike and I all this valuable insight on running a small business, insight that you’re not going to learn about in any classroom in college. There wasn’t anything really challenging about this project. The drive was kind of tough for me, as I had to drive 45 minutes down to the South Shore every day. Sometimes some of the work gets really boring. Mike O’Brien had us editing pictures for the website a lot and the job gets very repetitive and is extremely boring to perform but there is a rewarding feeling to finally upload the pictures to the website and see that your pictures are going to be viewed by people you don’t even know. Although some of the tasks that we were put on can get boring, none of the tasks ever seemed like they were useless. All of the tasks that we had to do were important to the company. People are going to see the pictures that we added to the website and that will help sell product; taking inventory of the entire warehouse is very crucial to the company so they know how many shoes they have to sell; sticking price tags on every pair of shoes is crucial for the stores that will sell the shoes. I would definitely recommend this project to someone. The people who we worked with were great guys and always kept the mood light. There is always busy work to do, so if you’re someone who likes to be lazy this job might not be for you, but the work is never difficult. I personally always like to be doing something so this job was a good fit for me. Our boss bought us lunch nearly every day which was an unexpected bonus. Finally, Mike O’Brien gave us a few free pairs of shoes to keep, a $60 value that we got for free. </p>');

I especially liked that I was able to witness the full process of selling shoes. I saw how ideas for shoes can be made, often based off of previous models, and ordered for foreign manufacturing. Then, I was able to actually take part in the rest of the business process, which included organizing the inventory and gathering orders to be shipped out for sale. This inside look was interesting because I realized that there are many pieces to the puzzle of selling a good. I saw the order placements from retailers like Bob’s and then got to actually gather the order and prepare it for shipment. At some companies, I would only have been able to help with either the warehouse labor or the office work exclusively. However, at Island Surf I was lucky enough to participate in the full realm of business activity. I enjoyed the balance between working at the computer and in the warehouse. On the computer, I edited pictures of merchandise and updated the company website. I got a sense of what it takes to actually run a business the way that the O’Brien family does. Mike O’Brien especially helped to explain the different facets of running their business and I appreciate his help because I felt like I learned something new everyday by working there.  One of the challenges I faced was staying focussed on an activity that I was bored of, such as editing photos for long periods of time or taking inventory in the warehouse. The repetitive tasks like editing pictures of shoes for the website were certainly not entertaining or stimulating enough to do for hours on end, so it was difficult to stay motivated while editing for long periods of time. Taking inventory of our stock in the warehouse was a daunting task, but it is vital to running an efficient business. We had to work our way through almost the entire warehouse and note the number or each size of each style of shoe in stock. This job took all day and I was wearisome by the end of it. However, I did remember that businesses have to remain efficient in order to earn profits and to grow. Keeping track of inventory is a key task that helps a company understand its financial situation and product status. Though important to running a business, these were definitely two of the most challenging tasks I had to do while working at Island Surf.  I learned that I could see myself working a a business that sells goods like Island Surf, but I am not sure that it is my dream job. I liked the way that Island Surf is run by small groups of people covering a lot of the work. I think that I can see myself best when involved in an array of activities as opposed to sitting in a cubicle all day. I understand that Island Surf is a unique small business, so it is difficult to find a place with the same atmosphere to work. Also, I feel that Island Surf’s business is a tricky one to operate, the staff is limited and the work fluctuates immensely because selling boat shoes is seasonal. When Mike had us to help with the workload the was certainly a lot of tasks he just could not get around to doing, such as the trivial pictures and inventory. Nevertheless, I thought that the job was a satisfying experience because it was my first time working at a sales motivated business and I was learning something new all the time. I recommend this project to any RL senior who wants to get some business world experience. I think that kids would find the balance of labor refreshing and the aspects of running a business interesting. </p>');

I assisted the whole 6th grade on their African NGO project which was made up of various outlines showing their tasks, building a website to advertise their cause, and then creating a model or presentation of their organization. On the other hand, I assisted a 9th grade Algebra class on their home building project. They were tasked to create a scale model of a house using all of the Algebraic methods they had learned throughout the year. I thought that this may be my hardest course to assist with, naturally because I had learned algebra many years ago. But luckily they were dealing with pretty basic concepts and it naturally came back to me.</p>','<p>To visit my former school was an overall fantastic experience. Fessenden was my home for four years, and the friends I made there became my family. Seeing all the familiar faces made me remember and reminisce about all the incredible memories I have of that school.  The most rewarding aspect of my project was definitely contributing to the school that has given so much to me. Being able to make a positive contribution to a community that molded both my personality and character was really gratifying, and seeing kids whose position I was in not too long ago really emphasized my dedication to my work.  Probably the most difficult part of my experience was understanding that I was actually an teacher and not a student. This fact was most apparent when younger kids would look at me like a teacher and not a peer. It was slightly uncomfortable and it took some time to get used to. But the teachers who had actually taught me made me part of their community, and by the end of my time, I was incredibly comfortable around them.  I learned a lot about teaching during my time at Fessenden. I really recognized certain difficulties that I had no idea existed when I was a student. Being a teacher doesn’t include just teaching, but also managing the classroom. Sixth grade boys are not easy kids to teach, and making them actually focus on the material was pretty difficult. But the feeling of accomplishment I got when they were finally willing to learn was amazing. It made me seriously think that teaching was a job I might consider in the future. My only regret was that I didn’t have enough time with the kids I was interacting with. I think with more time I could have gotten closer to the kids, and perhaps then they might have opened up more to me and to learning. Nevertheless, the few weeks I was able to spend at Fessenden were incredible, and I would absolutely recommend this ISP to any RL senior, whether Fessenden alumnus or not. </p>');

We started off the ISP drafting storyboards and finalizing a screenplay, which we then gave to our off­campus advisor, Mr. Michael Kilmurray (RL ‘95), to be formatted in the standard professional form (complete with all acting cues, dialogue, and prop/costume/character lists). In addition, Mr. Kilmurray equipped us with two shotgun microphones* to go along with the camcorder and microphone stand we had borrowed from Mr. Piper, making sure that we were ready to film as soon as possible. The acting was extremely enjoyable, although actors were sometimes difficult to organize, and the filming itself was rewarding (getting artistically pleasing shots, experimenting with different angles, etc.) but difficult, especially in scenes where both of our characters were needed. As our confidence with the equipment grew, we learned of ways to get around this problem, strategically placing microphones around the scene and enlisting the help of a friend or tripod to hold the camera. We then spent the majority of our time editing our project, working our way through our collection of many unusable takes to string together the best­looking scene, adding music to the soundtrack and adjusting audio levels/sound effects, and editing the footage itself in iMovie to add or change speeds, saturation levels, and credits. We are happy to say that our initial enthusiasm continued throughout the project, but we quickly learned that the crucial intricacies of film production are both abundant and very easy to overlook if there is any lack of meticulousness; the project was very useful in that it introduced us to the detailed world of behind­the­scenes media production while reminding us of the inherent limitations that lack of experience, connections, and funding in the industry impose.</p><p>*we experimented with another type of close­range vocal microphone as well, but the shotgun mics were far better at picking up general area sound as well as distinguishable dialogue.</p>','<p>For my ISP, I worked on an original short film with Jared Ginnetty.  Film has always intrigued us both, and we were excited to embark on this project.  We began writing the screenplay in February so that we could hit the ground running once ISP’s officially began.  Our usual daily routine consisted of Jared coming up to my house in West Roxbury.  There we would work on whatever we could for that day, depending on what actors were available, etc.  There were many days where we couldn’t do much, whether because actors were unavailable or equipment was unavailable.  I found our project to be extremely rewarding.  Although it was stressful at times, learning how to plan out and be most efficient in the filmmaking process was great.  We learned how to plan out shoots before actors arrived so as not to waste their time.  We learned how to edit film with iMovie.  We learned how to properly format a screenplay.  The most challenging part of our project was the fact that a lot of it was out of our control.  All of our actors were doing their own ISP’s, and it became difficult to find time to shoot.  Our sound equipment was rented from Harvard through our off-campus advisor, but we could only get the equipment for 24-hour periods and we had to give fair warning that we needed it, so we had to really plan out when we wanted to shoot.  Another factor out of our control was weather (it’s hard to film on a rainy day when the film takes place in the sun).  I would recommend this project to someone who really loves film.  Watching the final product was one of the most rewarding things for us, but it was not all fun and games.  It took a lot of hard work, so I wouldn’t recommend this to someone who just wants to hang out and goof off for his ISP.  Making a film is not for the faint of heart.</p>');

While we thought we were up to making a seven-song album, our ISP became more of a collaborative effort to write and record good songs.  We ended up with five full-length songs (between two and three minutes each) that varied greatly.  Each day, we would convene in Nick’s project studio and record music.  Usually, we would begin with a melody and accompaniment, and then we translated those ideas into a musical arrangement.  Our five songs ranged from electro pop (“A Little Too Little”) to 60’s psychedelic rock (“Vicodin”).  While you may say that writing across genres seems a little all over the place, I would say that it really helped us maintain our creative momentum.  If we had limited ourselves to one sound or concept, we would not have gotten as much exposure to different methods of songwriting.</p>','<p>The project was most rewarding in that we demonstrated improvement over the course of the ISP.  While the first song took an entire week to record, the rest were two or three day adventures.  The most frustrating part of the process was always writing lyrics and then editing the audio.  To fast track the project, we really left the production of the songs to the very end, and kept the recording process focused on getting a good enough result fast.  While some of the nuances of the music were lost, we got the immediate gratification of putting an entire song together in only a day. I learned that writing and recording a good song that I can be proud of takes a good amount of effort but not necessarily much time.  I also learned that fidgeting with effects and sound banks stinks and never helps you hear what’s inside your head.  It’s a lot easier to write first and leave the production until the entire song is recorded.  Whenever we got caught up in getting a certain kind of sound before actually writing a melody and lyrics, we ended up giving up on the work we did.  I would definitely recommend this project, however the following caveat: don’t let the technology distract from the art.  We got the best results when we had our heads wrapped in the music rather than in the electronics.</p>');

Each day I would begin by writing for an hour, on whatever topic came to mind. For this one hour free-write, there were no guidelines and I didn’t let myself continue pre-existing projects. I just wrote. It was a good way to get the brain working and to get ready for the day. The rest of my day consisted of several things, not always in the same order. I would read for one hour, from a work of creative writing, such as a novel, short story collection, or poetry collection. I would also spend an hour or so a day reading The Triggering Town, a book on writing poetry by Richard Hugo. I gave at least one hour a day to my short story. I explored different formal poems, experimenting with the villanelle, sestina, pantoum, and sonnet. The rest of the time was spent writing new material, continuing existing projects, or editing pieces. Some days I did all of these things, some days I just did a few. There were days when my muse was especially active, so I did nothing but write and edit original material all day long. But I found that having a list of things to do helped me when I was having a hard time coming up with material.</p>','<p>One of the best pieces of advice that I received during my ISP came from my off-campus advisor, Mr. Kerner: get away from your desk, and out of your house. Go do stuff. I spent much of the first week chained to my desk, and my poetry from that week was predictably self-centered, disconnected, and shallow. When I was wondering what to write about, sitting inside at a desk with nothing but my thoughts, I basically ended up with pages of unfocused cerebral spillage. So after the first week, and Mr. Kerner’s advice, I let myself out a bit more. I helped out at the community garden, had lunch with friends, went to the museum, and just spent more time outside doing things. It helped tremendously. The things I did to get outside weren’t usually topics for my work, but they got me out of myself. Being out in the world, awake to life around me, was far more effective than sitting inside all day trying really hard to be creative. If you want to write, it helps a lot if you live.  My productivity is dependant upon how much space I have (or give myself). During the first week of the ISP, between Forum and the musical, I was spending eight hours a day at RL, and had to get all of my ISP work done before 2:00. With my other commitments, I felt like I couldn’t focus on my writing. The first day that I didn’t have to be at RL was Tuesday of the third week. Coincidentally (or not so coincidentally), this was also the day when I wrote three of the seven poems that appear in the final portfolio, having written almost nothing worthwhile in the preceding weeks. If I can take my time with my work, and not feel pressured by other commitments, I am far more productive. Seeing as unwanted commitments are a part of life, that means I’ll have to learn to not feel constrained or pressured by those commitments.</p><p>The other reason I produced more good work on that one Tuesday than I had in the first two weeks combined is that I’ve found the product of hard work comes easily. I spent two weeks working on material that didn’t go anywhere, and then all of a sudden these three poems come just like that. But I firmly believe that those three poems wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t spent all that time working during the first two weeks, even if none of the early projects went anywhere.  That brings me to another lesson learned: don’t try too hard. I remember one morning, when I spent about half an hour sitting outside under a tree trying to write a poem. I did write something, and I guess you could call it a poem, but it wasn’t much. I then moved to my porch and let my mind wander a bit. Suddenly, a line came into my head, and in five minutes I wrote a far better poem than the one I’d spent half an hour on, and on a completely different topic. If I relax and let myself write, without constantly stopping myself or trying to control the poem, the result is far better. The state that I’m in when I’m writing at my best is something close to meditation, and it’s a state I got much better at attaining over the course of my ISP.  I learned that short stories are really, really, really difficult. Not that poetry is easy, but it comes more naturally for me. The meditative, effortless state that I can sometimes find in my poetry is much harder for me to find in prose. I think it’s because in poetry, I let myself go. I let myself not make sense, and I see where the writing takes me. In prose, I feel the need to control the story, which chokes it. I need to learn to relinquish control the way I do in my poems. There’s probably some deep life lesson in there somewhere.  On the topic of deep life lessons, this project was a great chance to deepen my relationship with myself and take a good look at some of the big stuff in my life. When I’m writing in that meditative state I mentioned, I can’t fool myself. I can’t hide from myself. Whatever I’m feeling, whatever’s actually going on beneath my posing and suppression, it’ll come out, good or bad. I dealt with some important stuff over the course of the four weeks, and writing was helpful to the point of being therapeutic.  I would definitely recommend this project to anyone considering it. My writing improved, and I ended up with some good work to show for it. I learned a lot about my own writing process, and now I feel like I have much better feel for “how to write,” whatever that means. I also learned a lot about time management, discipline, and what conditions help me be productive. Most importantly, any art that is honest asks you to look deeper into yourself. This is a chance to take for weeks to explore your art, explore yourself, and explore the world around you through what you create, whether it be poetry, paintings, or music. And as for working by yourself, that will depend a lot on personality. I imagine there are a lot of students who would hate it, but even for them it might be helpful. You learn a lot about yourself when you take time to be alone. And if you make the effort, you can always find time to spend with friends.  There are two things that would have made the project more rewarding. First, if I had had fewer commitments outside of my ISP. I loved doing the musical and Forum, but I would have been far more productive in my writing if I hadn’t had other stuff to worry about. Same goes for all the times we were called in to RL. I realize that it’s necessary, but it’s hard to feel like the project’s actually “Independent” when you’re at the school every single day. Maybe if there were a way to condense all the required visits into one day? Then the time away would feel more uninterrupted: I find that I am more creative, happy, and centered, the less time I spend at RL. Don’t get me wrong, I love this place. I’m just being honest. The project also would have been more rewarding if it were longer.  I only got into a rhythm by the third week, and by then it was almost time to wrap up. I think that one or two additional weeks would be incredibly helpful.  Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding, challenging, and enjoyable project. I think it’s one of RL’s best traditions, and I thank everyone at the school for making ISP’s happen.</p>');

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I worked at the Nahrmann Bass Shop in Billerica. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I shadowed Joe Venezia of the Joint Service Anthropometric Survey Team at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center (Natick Labs). At the Nahrmann Bass Shop, I helped repair and restore old and broken acoustic double basses. Most of my time was spent making cleats and repairing cracks in old basses (as well as a few church basses and cellos). On certain occasions, if earlier repairs on a bass were no longer accomplishing their original purpose, I would undo the old repairs and clean up the inside of the bass. At other times, I helped Volker out with a number of different procedures involving bass repair, such as the making of adjustable bridge feet, planing a fingerboard, hairing a bow, and adjusting a soundpost. I also assisted him in preparing for his upcoming lecture on Abraham Prescott at an international bass convention. To that end, I worked on restoring a number of old Prescott basses (from around the early to mid 1800s), and took measurements of the dimensions of cellos, church basses, and double basses. I then analyzed these measurements to get a sense of the difference between church basses and cellos, and followed the changes in the design of basses as Prescott’s career developed. One of the biggest challenges for me was the fact that I had never played a bass, or any instrument in the violin family. This meant that I had a very limited knowledge of how the bass functioned, impeding my repair work in the beginning. However this was a challenge that I quickly overcame, as I developed a stronger understanding of the bass. From the project, I learned that I definitely enjoy artistic activities that involve creativity, and that I enjoy woodworking. Though much of the bass repair is grounded in scientific ideas and principles, at its core, the work is centered around feel and touch. It’s about feeling that two pieces fit together, feeling that a crack has been cleated sufficiently, feeling the sound. One other takeaway for me is that work is much more enjoyable when you actually like what you’re doing. I started each day at the bass shop happy simply because of the infectious enthusiasm of Volker; he clearly loved his job and so he showed up raring to go every morning. At the Natick Labs, I followed Joe Venezia of the Join Services Anthropometric Survey Team as he worked on seated workstation design. His work entailed analyzing data taken across two years about 12, 000 soldiers at about 20 Army bases around the country. The applications of the analysis affect the design of various pieces of military equipment, such as gloves, helmets, and body armor. The current project for the team is centered on seated workstation design. For his work, Mr. Venezia used Microsoft Excel and SAS (Statistical Analysis System) as his primary two programs. I essentially shadowed Mr. Venezia as he did his work. I watched him enter code for SAS, since I did not know how to use that program; then using the numbers that SAS had come up with, I used some Excel spreadsheets to crunch the numbers and churn out some analysis. The task at hand was to utilize principle component analysis to create a 90% ellipsoid for the variables relevant to the seated workstation design. My biggest takeaway from this component of my ISP is that I don’t think I want to work in such a setting; I don’t think I would enjoy sitting in front of a desk from 9 to 5 each day. I also learned to some extent the art of problem solving, simply from watching Mr. Venezia face and overcome new challenges in the course of his daily work. While I would definitely recommend working at a bass shop, or any project that includes a similar degree of artistic and creative license, I would not recommend working at a place like Natick Labs. To a certain degree, the ISP is the last chance for us to try something new, or try something that we are passionate about, but will likely not being exploring further later in life; thus I would suggest doing an ISP that is a little bit out there in terms of area of concentration. </p>');

One of them was helping out in the pro shop at George Wright, and the other was teaching lessons to willing students.  At the pro shop I did a lot of different tasks.  These included ringing people up at the front desk, acting as the starter, and driving around a golf cart with water on the back, and giving water to people on the course.  The job also allowed me to talk a lot with the head pro at the golf course, and I learned a lot about how a golf course is run.  The second part of my project was teaching lessons to willing students.  I had three regular students, Mr. Thornton, Mr. Buckley, and Josh Straub.  I would meet about once a week with each of them for 45 minutes to an hour depending on what we were covering that day.  Using technology I tried to coach them into improving their golf swings, and for the most part it was pretty successful.  I used a lot of the information I learned from the head pro at George Wright to teach my students, and the seemed to improve over the course of the four weeks.  </p>','<p>As a golf enthusiast this project was a lot of fun for me.  I learned so much more about the game I love, and I had the opportunity to attempt to apply what I thought I knew to teaching people.  The most rewarding part of my project was seeing the progress that my students made.  For the last lesson of my project I played a round of 9 holes with Mr. Buckley and Mr. Thornton, and seeing the progress that they had made was gratifying.  Even more than that however, I really loved seeing how much their understanding of the game increased.  Now, instead of wondering where their bad shots come from, they have an understanding of their mistakes, which provides them with the knowledge to fix what they are doing wrong.  I am sure that in the coming months these two will continue to improve dramatically, and I look forward to monitoring their improvement.  However, there were challenges that I ran into.  Teaching my students was one of the hardest things that I have ever attempted. Conveying the knowledge that I have into words that represent feel for the player is incredibly challenging.  I understand the right way to swing, and the basics of the game, and I have a feel for what the right way to swing is.  However, knowing and understanding the golf swing, and being able to get someone else to understand, and most importantly feel the right way to swing is really difficult and this was probably the most challenging part of my ISP.  I found that my students had a tough time breaking some of the bad habits they had gotten into, and it was frustrating at times to watch as they struggled to implement the advice I was giving them.  I learned that being a teacher can be incredibly frustrating at times, but that I really enjoyed the satisfaction of watching a student finally grasp a concept that they struggle with for a while.  This project could have been more rewarding for me if we had more space where I gave the lessons.  I gave the lessons on the upper field, and we were limited by both a lack of golf balls and a lack of space.  I wish I had had an unlimited amount of space on a range so I could work on every club with my students.  Overall, however, this project is the perfect project for someone who is serious about the game of golf, and I would absolutely recommend it.  </p>');

Usually, we would begin with a melody and accompaniment, and then we translated those ideas into a musical arrangement.  Our five songs ranged from electro pop (“A Little Too Little”) to 60’s psychedelic rock (“Vicodin”).

If we had limited ourselves to one sound or concept, we would not have gotten as much exposure to different methods of songwriting.  Probably the most rewarding part of this ISP, other than giving me a collection of new songs to listen to, was that I became a better and more creative songwriter throughout the process. For instance, when we first started the project it would take Nick and me several hours to develop a melody and verse with good lyrics, while by the end of our project we could do it in a fraction of the time. It used to take us several days to get a song from out of our heads to its finished form on the computer whereas we can now do that in a single day.  Our project also posed some challenges though. One challenge was that neither Nick nor I were able to play the electric or bass guitar proficiently when we needed those two instruments to be featured in our music. Furthermore, neither of us even owned a drum set, so all of our percussive sounds had to be electronic, a sound that was not always desired in our music. In the end, we overcame these challenges with the power of editing, but not without much difficulty. </p><p>This experience has helped me learn that I have the ability to develop skills effectively and efficiently as long as my efforts remain consistently strong. I also learned that although taking breaks can be relaxing, time is always better spent getting the job done early so I don’t feel pressure when the job is actually due. Had we more time to do this project, we probably would have written better songs and in turn had a more rewarding experience.  All things considered, I would definitely recommend this project because of the freedom, the rewards, and the fun that it gave me. Also, I was very lucky to work with Nick Kirsch who had already been producing music for several years. If someone should consider doing this type of project, he should make sure that either he or his partner has some form of experience in producing music.</p>');

I wasn’t nearly as good as I remembered myself being a year before after a year of Art 1 with Mr. Buckley. Slowly my skills came back, and it was rewarding to see that with a little practice I could work myself back up to a respectable amount of artistic skill. The paintings I created during my ISP provide clear and direct documentation of my increasing abilities. I enjoyed doing a project that I was self motivated to do, in which I didn’t have to force my work into a set schedule. I was free to shape my schedule, often sleeping in and then working late at night, or working on Sundays when I had nothing else to do. This project could have been more rewarding if I had spent more time sketching or doing small art projects leading up to my project. This would have been difficult with a busy spring schedule of sports, drama, and singing, but it would have been better to slowly ease myself back into art, rather than go from doing zero hours one day to five hours the next. I had unrealistic expectations in my mind that my artistic drive and talent would come back to me as soon as I picked up a paint brush, while in reality, it took me a little while not only to get good at art again, but also to enjoy and care about art again. While I really enjoyed my ISP, I learned that the life of an artist can drive me a little insane. While it’s relaxing, sitting in one place for hours painting can get boring, and can isolate you from the world. Also, since I had no structure to keep me on a regular schedule, I had a wildly erratic sleep schedule which often left me feeling foggy and tired. I would recommend that anyone else doing this project nail down a little more of a schedule for themselves. I would definitely recommend this as a senior project, but only if you really enjoy art. It might seem like and ISP that it would be easy to slack off in, but anyone who doesn’t have an actual drive to make art would likely be miserable and accomplish nothing. I would also warn that this ISP has you spending large amounts of time alone and isolated. This wasn’t a problem for me since I had sports, drama, and latonics pretty much every day, but for someone doing fewer extracurriculars, this ISP could wall you off form human contact. </p>');

From being a helping hand to the struggling artist to reading stories to the younger classes I was always on my feet, always “busy,” though the connotation of dryness and/or the lack of fun was nonexistent. Other tasks included glazing kids artwork, loading, firing, and unloading the kiln, and supervising during Teach sessions. I also did a bit of artwork on the side, though not as much as I hoped. I always find working with kids rewarding. They are very welcoming to your help, and generally they admire you, which makes even the most humble feel their pride swell a bit. Then the results of your teaching are also incredibly rewarding. A very different experience to actually doing the work yourself, but while it isn’t as personal, it is much more satisfying watching someone succeed from your help. I also enjoyed talking with my old mentor and friend Mrs. Cunningham-Terry (she still insists I call her Fern, but I can’t make that leap quite yet), during our down time. Time management was the most challenging. As much as the occasional rowdy class was a bit more difficult to deal with, in the end they are just kids, and can be brought back to focus. But finding time to do everything especially without a car to drive proved incredibly difficult. Between the Musical, Track, class meetings and alumni panels finding time to do my own artwork was nigh on impossible, and I spent many extra hours just so I could show something. I already knew I liked teaching kids, and honestly I don’t feel like I learned much, rather than got a better perspective on being a teacher. Not only with some improvised teaching techniques but I can relate to teachers much differently now that I know what its like to take control of a room. This project would have been more rewarding if in the first two weeks I spent more than 20 hours actually at my ISP. Again, between all my commitments and a sickness I was barely at Park at all. I would recommend this project, because you can’t go wrong with teaching kids. Especially in art, as childhood is one of the most creative times of a person’s life. Also its more fun than teaching boring low level math.</p>');

The most rewarding part of this project was printing an object and understanding that you had created something. The challenge of this project was that the industry of 3D printing is so new that wasn’t really an advisor we could turn to who had the answers. Though Mr. Piper was very helpful and certainly knew so tricks for using the printer, we had to figure out most of what we were supposed to do on our own. I learned that I, for the most part, could solve my problems on my own and that I am very motivated when interested on what I am working on. This project would have been more rewarding had we been able to print out all the designs we wanted to, but unfortunately we were not able to do that. I would recommend this project because I think it was not only fun and interesting, but also because 3D printing is a growing industry that will only keep getting bigger, so kids should have the chance to have some experience with the printer.</p>');

The second week I developed a template on Excel to help Julie log, systematize, and organize her 500+ clients in a more efficient manner. The last project was helping Sean Myers finish gathering email addresses of the local high school coaches and athletic directors to see if they had any interest in having Julie come to their school and speak to their athletes. Every aspect of my project from time management to understanding a small business to all the nutritional facts I learned were very rewarding. The most challenging part of my project was dealing the supplier of the promotional items and understanding that we were a small business with a relatively small order and budget where there were ‘bigger fish to fry’. I was respectful to the supplier and simply stayed on them to make sure our order was going to be ready for the date we set. I would absolutely recommend this project for all the reasons I mentioned but specifically because Julie Nicolletti was so passionate about what she does and was such a sweet and pleasant off-campus advisor it was a pleasure to work with her. </p>','<p>For our independent senior project, we decided to explore the realm of acting. We decided to practice, and ultimately perform, 4 shorts scenes. These scenes were, in no particular order: Who’s on First and 13*7=28, by Abbott and Costello, The Sanity Clause, by the Marx Brothers, and an excerpt Act 1 Scene 3 from King Lear. We chose three comedy scenes because we are very interested in comedy, but also chose a Shakespeare scene because we wanted to have variety in the skits we performed. In addition to just rehearsing the scenes, however, we also practiced acting techniques, such as the Meisner technique. This technique involves the repetition of a single phrase over and over, and seeks to draw out the emotions behind an action, instead of only putting in the words. It forces the actor to really express, rathan than just repeat memorized lines. This is something we were striving to do in this project, so we utilized this particular technique often.  I think the most rewarding thing about this experience is that I got to share it with my good friend, Luke. We both have a great passion for theater, so being able to spend the month acting with him was a great experience-- especially since we are going off to different colleges, and probably won’t be able to act together again. The most challenging part of the project is definitely acting without a director. Whenever I was on stage before, I always had someone to give me notes, telling me how to be better; however, during this month, it was all on me. Every acting choice, every stage movement, it was all on me to decide. Similarly, this project made me realize how truly important a director is: during our last meeting with Mr. Nelson, he gave us notes on King Lear. I relished them. I finally had something to work on, a way to make my performance better. So I think something that I learned about myself is that, while its never fun to be critiqued, i really value constructive criticism on my acting. After all, I am performing for an audience, so it doesn''t matter how I feel i did, it matters how they feel I did. I think that this project would have been more rewarding if it had encompassed more people. I realize putting on a full scale production in a month is nearly impossible, but limiting it to two people was rather disappointing. For one thing, the scope of what scenes we could do was severely limited, for we had to chose some with only two people in them. Another reason why it would have been nice to work with more people is that it is fun and exciting. When you are on the stage, you draw your energy not only from the audience, but also from your fellow actors: you feed of their energy and, if you are a good actor, send it right back to them. That way, when you are on stage, your emotions can always be their fullest. I would definitely recommend this project to anyone who loves acting: while its a bit boring the first week when you are just bouncing lines back and forth, the end result in so fulfilling. And adding scenes to your repertoire is always useful. For example, Luke and I performed Whos on first for our dates at prom, and while some people gave us strange glances, our dates laughed in delight. In the end, this process was a very enjoyable process, and I am very happy to have done it.</p>');

For me the combination of physical fitness and nutrition was so rewarding for me because I learned so many little tips that I didn’t know and now I can bring them with me to Bentley next year for football and even for the rest of my life. It was also rewarding from the aspect of responsibility. At IPF part of my job was to set up lifts for incoming groups and it was my responsibility to make sure the lift was set up correctly on top of the gym being spotless and clean. The responsibility aspect of kinetic fuel was that Julie gave me two main missions while I was there and it was my job to get them done on my own time. One of them was to send an email to football coaches from the ISL and the Hockomock League in order to inquire if they were interested in having Julie meet with their team. The other mission was a dual project with Mackay. Our job was to create a data base for Julie to catalogue all her clients and their personal information. That was very rewarding because it was somewhat business orientated which was great for me since I have an interest in pursuing business. I would say the most challenging part of my project was the commuting. Driving 110 miles three days a week can take a toll on you and it wears you down and on top of that I had to travel to meet with Julie. In a sense that was good for me because when I get to the point of my life where I am commuting to work everyday I will have a better idea of what thats like. I would definitely recommend this project to anyone who is playing sports in college and also has an interest in personal training. It gives you a real idea of what its like being a trainer and what a typical day entails. I would recommend this to more than just an athlete though, I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in personal health. You will get stronger and more athletic and you will learn how to fuel and eat the right way so you have way more energy then you would have. It was great and I found myself wishing I could have done it for four more weeks but I really appreciated the opportunity. </p>');

It was fascinating for me to meet a couple of different people and listen to what they had to say. My initial goal was to get viewers of the documentary to open their eyes and think a little bit more about the questions that surround the atheism vs. theism debate, and I found myself doing just that all along the way, from the first interview all the way to the finished product. The most rewarding aspect of this project was meeting new people and listening to new ideas. I learned a lot about others and myself throughout the process and this has been one of the more valuable experiences regarding the god question for me. A project as enjoyable as this was not without its challenges, however. I found some difficulties in finding the right people for the task and then finding the time to interview them. At least two people were slated to participate but were later unable to, and at one point I found myself scrambling to fill in the position. Fortunately, I did find the right man, but two weeks into the project. This set me back a little bit, but a few extra hours here and there put me back on track. Ultimately, my planning beforehand made these setbacks minor and manageable. Once things were smoothed out, my project progressed well and the finished product turned out just as I had hoped.  Challenges aside, I would absolutely recommend doing a project like this to anybody and everybody in the future. I was able to work on something for 5 weeks that was very important to me and has been for a few years now. I can guarantee that anybody who decides to make a documentary about anything important to them, they will find the work easy to get into and the product rewarding at its worst and thought-provoking if not profound at its best. I feel as though I have achieved both those results in this project, and encourage anybody to pursue their interests in a documentary or film in future years.</p>');

In it, we were creating a chess program on Java.  As a base for this program we used a program we had worked with extensively in the AP computer science class, Gridworld.  As the name implies, we primarily used this program as the foundation for the grid or board.  The original intention was to create a program capable of player vs player and player vs computer play.  However, player vs player proved more complicated than expected and we never managed to create player vs computer functionality.  Our daily schedule consisted of meeting at Brian’s house and programming until I had to leave for lacrosse practice (ie from 9-2 on average).</p>','<p>My project was to create a chess program on Java.  Because I was doing this project with Brian Evans, my daily schedule consisted of meeting with Brian at his house and coding until I had to leave for lacrosse.  So we usually worked from 9 to about 2.  The project proved somewhat more challenging than expected.  Originally, I had hoped that we would be able to make a program which could support player vs player and player vs computer games.  However, we had enough trouble as it was with the player vs player, so we never quite advanced to player vs computer.  Simply put, there were many roadblocks along the way that we hadn’t quite foreseen.  This proved to be simultaneously both the most challenging and most rewarding aspect of the ISP.  I’ll illustrate with an example.  One of the most problematic glitches in our program is that for a very long time, bishops could jump over pieces, which is obviously not allowed in chess.  It seems like this would be a relatively simple thing to stop, but we had a great deal of difficulty in fixing this problem.  It was unexpected obstacles like this that made the ISP worthwhile.  While they were no doubt often frustrating, I found it satisfying to find the solutions and I quite enjoyed the process of code, test, debug, code, test…until it worked as intended.  I am not sure that I learned anything in particular about myself, but it was still nonetheless worthwhile.  I certainly improved a lot as a programmer over the course of the ISP.  Moreover, I learned a lot about creating and adhering to my own schedule, as well as how to work on a project with little direct supervision.  I think the project would have been more rewarding if we had accomplished more of our original goals, namely the player vs computer functionality.  That having been said, I would absolutely recommend this project to anyone who is interested in computer science.  Certainly, the project is not for everyone.  To start with, I think it would be nearly essential that one have taken the AP Computer Science class.  Additionally, to take on the project, one would have to be the type of personality who would work effectively on an ISP with little direct supervision.  I think an interesting proposition would be that if someone wanted to repeat this ISP or do something similar, I could give him the program we made for this project.  Then, they could extend it, fix the glitches, and add artificial intelligence.  </p>');

I also revolutionized the way they make orientation binders and cut down the time it takes to make one from around an hour and a half to fifteen minutes.The rewarding part of my project is also the most challenging part. Seeing kids who knee themselves in the nose and break it whenever they are presented with a math problem is a challenging image. I also didn’t like getting up at 6AM every day and driving 45 minutes to Andover. There were also some times when Amanda was doing orientation training and I finished the task list she gave me. Since I wasn’t really allowed to go out of her office without her accompaniment, I would be stuck in a room for some period of time with nothing to do. I definitely watched some shows on Netflix during those times.  This project would have been more rewarding had I been able to observe more classrooms. However, teachers are required to have at least a pending master’s degree so I understand why I couldn’t. These kids are very complex and intense so I am definitely not prepared to handle anything they have to offer. I would recommend this project to someone who lives closer to Andover. The commute was brutal. If not, I would recommend finding a similar project at a school closer to Boston. </p>');

I worked at the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), shadowing Mrs. Petrina Garbarini, a construction manager.  Mrs. Gabarini taught me a lot about architecture and other related fields in construction.  I not only saw what she did from day to day, but I also saw what other architects and construction managers alike did on a typical day of work.  For the second half of my project, I would paint the Chestnut Hill Reservoir and Waterworks condominium complex, working on an abstract 24” x 36” masterpiece of an architectural landscape.  I would also meet with an RL mom, Nicole de Lisle, every Friday for a nice critique of my artwork. </p>','<p>The most rewarding part of the project was challenging myself by taking a risk and exploring myself as a painter.  I tried a lot of new things during this project, as I had never worked on such large a scale before, I had never worked outside before, and I had also never spent so much time doing small studies for a painting (especially in gouache! an opaque, water-based medium).  While the large canvas allowed me much more freedom, it completely altered my approach to painting and came with different and new challenges.  Instead of working with the usual 18” x 24” canvas Mr. Buckley had me using, I had a lot of extra canvas that I was not used to working with (as this one was twice as wide).  My time at Harvard FAS was not the most fun time of my life, but it was a necessary for me to learn about architecture.  Since I like art and math and my dad was a construction worker, I wanted to investigate architecture to see if I might like studying it in college.  Before this project, I did not really know what an architect did day-to-day (finding that, especially at the entry level, architects mostly work at a computer all day, designing very little) and I did not know what it was like to study architecture and work your way up to the top (which I heard is a slow grind).  This half of the project taught me that maybe I was not born to become an architect.  I will probably end up switching to engineering next fall, and I’m glad that I learned this now instead of a year or two into my degree, as this valuable knowledge will save me both time and money!!!  I also learned what it would be like to paint as a full-time job, which similarly dissuaded me from taking any art courses in college.  Oil painting for my ISP, however, did teach me what it would be like to paint as a hobby in college.  I am now much more likely to spend my free time painting in college and this summer.  If you are interested in art and especially improving your skills as an oil painter, I strongly suggest that you work on the largest piece of canvas you can find, and even with different dimensions that you’re used to working with.  It may not turn out as well as some of your other work, but it both give you a lot of freedom and allows you to try something new, which will lead to growth as a painter and will force you to think about a routine activity like painting in a completely new way.  I do recommend, however, that you work with a knowledgeable off-campus advisor who can guide you well along the way.  Nicole de Lisle offered great advice that I will even carry on into my other art projects in the future.  She pushed me to become more “painterly” and to experiment with a wide array of colors, utilizing my entire palette as a whole. The only thing I would change about this ISP is to make it longer.  A big masterpiece likes this with studies and everything takes far more than a month. Some of your other classmates, however, who only signed up for internships may not like the extra time on their hands, but it’d be OK for this project, because you would balance informational work, like shadowing someone, with work that you truly love.  I would definitely say that, if you’re thinking about specializing in a career in college (which you probably are, unless you’re going liberal arts), you should do some sort of internship in that field of study to see where you might end up with that college degree.  BUT I would also recommend that you only do the internship part time, and that you balance that work with something you genuinely.  If you interned five days a week, your time would mostly consist of shadowing people, which is frankly terrible; watching some one work without even helping out could get extremely monotonous after a while.</p>');

We have designed, constructed, and programmed a robot while also building from scratch the 12’ x 12’ arena in which the robot competes. Mechanically, we composed the robot of metal and plastics from the VEX Robotics Design System, with four-wheel drive geared for speed (at the cost of some torque) and a rotational actuator with two degrees of freedom for object manipulation. We have programmed it using a variation of the language C to activate on our command and run autonomously for a set period of time before switching to manual control. After some deliberation, we determined our game strategy to have the robot lift irregularly shaped plastic objects (specifically, truncated icosahedrons – colloquially known as “buckyballs”) to a height of several times its own and release them into goal zones attached to the field wall, a task that we are pleased our robot can now execute with a high level of consistency.</p>','<p>For this project, Dan and I spent the first two weeks acquiring, cutting, and assembling the material for the competition field''s walls and obstacles. Only once all of the unique pieces for the Vex competition arrived were we able to begin working on the robot in the confines of the competition field and its obstacles (because Vex didn''t release the details of this year''s competition until the last week of April, we were not able to order the pieces early enough to have them arrive at the beginning of our ISP). For the last two weeks we designed and built our robot, continually modifying the robot''s design and programming as we troubleshooted the various problems that arose.  This project was both rewarding and challenging in that we were forced to address many problems with the design and programming of our robot. Problems would come up at just about every point during our robot''s construction, whether we were just screwing in the pieces, writing our program for the robot, or using the controller to work with the robot. While all these problems were certainly frustrating when they arose, in hindsight it was satisfying when we were able to independently come up with solutions to our problems. For example, our original claw design couldn''t grab the scoring objects and sagged; so, we bent various metal pieces to elongate the claw so that it could grab the objects and to create a make-shift sleigh for the claw so that it would not sag. We went through many different designs for our claw until we arrived at our eventual solution for this problem and, even in the final design for the claw, we had to resolve the problems that arose with the new design. It was definitely rewarding when we were finally able to have our robot regularly move the scoring objects into the correct areas. In the end, I think I found this project as rewarding as it could have been as we accomplished the goals we had set out to accomplish at the beginning of the project.  I would recommend this project to anyone interested in robotics or in engineering in general. Personally, I enjoyed the experience of working with my hands to construct the competition field and the robot as such experiences are rare in the RL curriculum. I believe that this project has enough basic guidelines so that anyone who attempts it would have a solid starting point but also is open-ended enough for anyone who attempts it to creatively design their own robot. This project is rewarding in that it teaches creative problem-solving and in that manner I would recommend the project to everyone. Overall, I would say that anyone who enjoys working with their hands and who enjoys a mental challenge should take on this project.</p>');

I spent the first two weeks downstairs in the prep room. My worst day was my first day downstairs—I cut 100 pounds of onions, 50 pounds of carrots, and 36 pounds of butter. After that, I was regretting my ISP choice entirely. However, my time got better. I made good friends with the Portuguese workers by speaking Spanish with them, and enjoyed eating delicious pastries brought in by one of them whose wife owns a bakery in Brighton. Although at times tedious, the great feeling of finishing a big load of carrots or onions and being able to take a break was well worth it. The second week I worked up in the line. My main job was tossing salads, but I also did a lot of frying and toasting. The worst part of working upstairs was definitely the short stints in the dishwashing room—however, this was balanced by the pride of feeding people delicious food. It was exciting to know that people were paying for salads and chicken parms that I was making myself, with no one else helping. It made me feel like a true chef. This project was rewarding in several ways: it taught me that cooking is easy, enjoyable, and that the most important part of the process is often in preparation, and not necessarily execution. I learned some interesting techniques and great tips for cooking—however, that said, I would definitely recommend this project more for people who are interested in the running of a restaurant and entering the culinary business instead of someone who was simply learning to cook. If you want that, buy a cookbook or watch the food channel. With free lunch meals, though, it is probably the best paid ISP out there—if you consider free steak bombs, calamari, bacon mac and cheese, and seafood linguine good compensation.    </p>');

One thing that I loved about my project was that it combined two things in which I was and am interested. When I set out to choose a project I was thinking of something either in film or in psychology. This documentary about BPD allowed me to combine those two interests. In addition, I gained a ton of knowledge about BPD, which is helpful with that particular disorder, but it also informs my knowledge of mental illness in general. I know that after this project I will be much more accepting of mental illness because I understand better the factors and difficulty that come with it. The intense emotions and instability in the lives of the mentally ill is perhaps the most difficult thing to deal with in life, and I have an appreciation and an understanding of what that might be like for the mentally ill. I am not saying that I totally understand the situation, but I definitely have a better grasp on what those situations are like for the people with the disorders and for their families. I think this project would have been more rewarding for me if I could have met some more people with the disorder. Because of the limits on doctor patient confidentiality and other such restrictions, I was unable to access a number of patients, which would have better formed my understanding of the disorder as a whole. I think that I was lucky to find a lot of information on YouTube, but I think that a more in-depth study of patients would have been incredibly helpful. In addition, I think that I would have like a little bit more creativity in the project. I understand now that my job in creating this documentary was more of reporting than creating, but I think if I were to do it over I would chose to do something a little bit more focused around creativity. That being said, I would definitely recommend this project or a project like it. I think combining two skills like film and psychology is very valuable and has to potential to be full of new and different experiences. I think that it would be difficult to do this project if you were not able to self motivate, because I essentially did the whole project on my own. Both of my advisors were very helpful, but it was more up to me to make the contacts and find my way through the project. If someone wants to do a documentary, they need to be interested in the subject matter as well. I would find myself looking up BPD in my free time because I wanted to get a better sense of the disorder. I would constantly search YouTube looking for some new material or interesting information. In order to make a good documentary, it takes a lot of dedication to the subject matter. I really enjoyed my ISP because I was able to control it, and I was really interested in what I was studying. </p>');

Because the Vex season runs through April of each year, we were only able to place an order for parts to be used for this current year’s season at the very beginning of our project, and so they did not arrive until roughly halfway through our project. We were, however, able to put the first two weeks to good use by acquiring materials to cut and assemble into the homemade competition field that we constructed (as an alternative to the very expensive pre-fabricated field), while also considering potential robot designs that we could implement after the parts arrived. Once they did, we were able to commence the construction and programming of our robot, modifying each to address the issues that would continuously arise right up until we finished our robot (or, more accurately, brought it to a level of performance and consistency with which we were satisfied, since the old adage “there’s no such thing as perfection” was especially applicable to our efforts in this project). The most rewarding aspect of our project undoubtedly was the chance to see our robot come to life as we built and programmed it with our own hands. Of course, this process also provided for some greatly frustrating challenges. Along every stage of our project, there were mechanical and technological problems that we had to work out before we could proceed to our next task. Most infuriating perhaps was a wire whose ostensible function was to download programs from our computer to the Cortex (the “brain” of the robot, so to speak), but which had a complication, well-documented among Vex teams, of simply being unable to relay digital information of any sort. It was, for all intents and purposes, a long tube of plastic with metal wire stuck to each end. We eventually found a non-technical workaround, but we were displeased that we could not implement a fundamental solution that addressed the root cause of this problem, unlike most that we faced and were able to solve on a deeper level. One such solution of which we were particularly proud was a re-design of our original claw, which either was too small to grab the scoring objects we were targeting, or would severely sag and drag along the ground if we extended the claw arm. After many efforts to ameliorate these, we came upon a design that involved bending several metal strips into a configuration that would simultaneously entrap the scoring objects in a cage of sorts while also serving as “skis” that bore a large amount of weight while minimizing the effect of friction on the movement of our robot. We were pleasantly surprised to discover an additional benefit of this design which we had not even intended, but quickly manifested itself upon testing. Specifically, the metal strips would align the claw with the goal posts in an orientation that would virtually guarantee correct placement of any scoring object in its grasp. Without them, it was a hit-or-miss endeavor in which the claw could easily glance off the goal post and throw the scoring object out of bounds. Indeed, what likely ended up being the highest point-yielding aspect of our design was one we came upon by accident.  I would without hesitation recommend this, or a similar project, to any future students with interests in computer science, mechanical engineering, or any related field. Between the mathematics of gear ratios, the physics of lever forces, and the hands-on work of construction, there’s something for everyone in robotics. My only regret was that the duration of our project was not long enough for us to further work on the robot’s autonomous mode. While we were able to implement a very limited degree of artificial intelligence, there were infrared sensors, motion detectors, and many other devices that we could not integrate into our design for lack of time. On the whole, however, our experience was overwhelmingly positive. Between all that our project taught us about mechanical design, robotics software programming, and dynamic problem-solving (it frequently felt as if solving one issue would do nothing but cause two more to pop up), I’d like to think that we also discovered something about ourselves – how little working on something that is thoroughly stimulating feels to us like, well, work.</p>');

Our first move, of course, was to plan out the basic idea and design of the Kart, although it was impossible to plan out the whole thing in advance because we didn’t know exactly what parts we would have. We decided to build a one-seat Go Kart made out of a material called angle iron; we also decided not to weld anything on the Go Kart, since it would be costly and difficult to learn how to weld. We then built a basic rectangular frame, onto which we added, over the course of the ISP, the following: a steering system for the front two wheels, an engine mount on the back to which we attached a 6.5 horsepower engine, a seat and footboard for the comfort of the rider, a steering wheel/ Frisbee, a drive system made out of a clutch, chain, sprocket, axle, and back wheels, and acceleration and brake pedals wired to the engine and brake, respectively. The project took way more than the allotted six hours a day, but it never felt like work. We had a ton of fun and learned a lot about engineering. </p>','<p>Building a go-kart from nothing was much more labor intensive than I thought it would be from the start. Not having access to welding for the construction of our go-kart created many unanticipated issues throughout the construction, and there are close to no resources available that give advice on how to build a go-kart without welding, as it is much more convenient. Furthermore, we entered into this project with minimal experience in dealing with metal, engines, and moving parts. We had to learn as we went, oftentimes the hard way, refining things such as our cutting techniques and our concepts/plans on how we would attach various parts. While the words “labor intensive” (above) imply hard, gruesome work, in this case the work was genuinely enjoyable. I looked forward to each day of work on the go-kart, except for the moments of frustration when Mickey and I temporarily encountered seemingly unsolvable problems. There is something innately and surprisingly satisfying about building a physical, functional object from nothing, perhaps because in a way the object is your child—without you it would not exist, and it contains a part of your person, in the case of a go-kart your effort, thought, and creativity. The biggest challenges we faced in this project were both finding (most often complicated) ways to use bolts in places where welding would be much more simple, and making precision cuts and holes in metal. The best example of how not having access to welding was very inconvenient is in our method of attaching brackets which hold the front wheels to the frame. With welding, the bracket could have been attached in less than a half hour, planning and work combined. However we had to use two uniquely cut pieces of angle iron and four sets of bolts, washers, and nuts, almost all of different sizes. On top of planning how these components would be arranged to attach the bracket securely, we had to cut extremely precise holes through tough iron, and shorten one bolt with a saw so that it would fit in place. Cutting through metal, especially drilling holes in exact locations, was extremely difficult. If one hole was almost unnoticeably off in one direction, the bolt would not fit through at all, and we would have to file extensively to fix the hole. While the challenges we faced may have made someone who is not committed to and motivated for the end product give up, the dream of a functioning go-kart and the satisfaction from completing a working part gave me the drive to finish the go-kart. Over the course of the project, I found in myself a self-born source of motivation and passion for doing that, for the most part, had remained untapped—more often than not I have found myself forcing work, schoolwork, etc. out of myself, rather than the pure, unadulterated, and genuine work I have put into the go-kart. I look forward to being able to tap into this reserve more in the future, as I focus my path of work and study more. Looking back on my ISP, I wish I had both realized how much work building a go-kart requires, and planned out the go-kart better from the start, rather than letting evolve so much over time. I would without a doubt recommend this project, especially to someone looking for exposure to hands-on building, and the mechanics/workings of the physical world, not just the theoretical. I learned not only specific methods of building with metal and for moving parts, but also how to approach problems and solve them.</p>');

Each day that we arrived, we were given a task to help out the school in some way. Our goal was to ultimately teach a class or at least interact with the students on an academic level or to get to know the students. The day to day tasks we were given ranged from organizing binders to folding and organizing clothes to bubbling form sheets and cleaning the gym. In addition to this, we went through Epiphany’s inventory and report our results back to Mr. Jones. Although we were not expecting to do these menial tasks, we knew that it had a profound effect on the school and especially the faculty. The school was getting ready for a trip to Groton school which Epiphany had a summer program.</p>','<p>"Epiphany School is an independent, tuition-free middle school for children of economically-disadvantaged families from Boston neighborhoods.

In close partnership with families, we are an innovative learning community that affords structured support to help students thrive. Together we are a school that never gives up on a child. Epiphany challenges students to discover and develop the fullness of their individual gifts. We seek to prepare graduates who will contribute intelligently, morally, and actively to the society they will inherit."</p><p>Working at the Epiphany school has given me a new outlook on what happens behind the scenes not just in the classroom. Although our tasks were not as glamorous as we wanted them to be, the effects of completing the tasks were substantial. I, Maher and Will were aware that we were helping the teachers and ultimately the school. The teacher that we worked with, Mr. Jones, gave us a sundry of his extra work during exam week. We helped him organize 71 binders for the students which saved him a lot of time and energy. In addition to this, we folded shorts shirts sweaters and sweatpants of different sizes for the different grade levels. When we completed the task, we felt a feeling of instant gratification. The main obstacle of each task we were given was time. The tasks were mind-numbing and tedious which made time go slow. To pass the time, we would occasionally play basketball amongst ourselves or with the kids during recess. That was one of the few times we interacted with the kids. The other time was when the students were taking exams and Maher, Will and I read/proctored the students. Working at Epiphany has made me appreciate what teachers do for the students. Teachers help facilitate the students’ academic and personal life. It taught me to say thank you and appreciate the hard work and time they put in. If epiphany gave me the opportunity to work there again, I would so, but this time I would prefer to teach a class. I want to experience what it is like to be the head. I want to feel what it is like to be a teacher, a mentor, someone to look up to. I want to gain that experience. If Maher Will and I had the opportunity to teach, we would recommend doing this, but unfortunately we did not thus we would not recommend doing this. The tasks were boring to be completely honest, and at times we felt like it was a waste of time. At some moments, the teachers ran out of tasks for us to do which left us doing nothing.</p>');

To achieve this goal we visited six different courses in the area, three public and three private, in order to see how they run their course. Like many things in life there are many different ways to accomplish the same task. This holds true for running a golf course. Each superintendent had his own way of using the resources at his disposal to attack the maintenance of his course. In order to learn what these superintendents do on a daily basis we shadowed them for a day or two depending on the course. This gave us great insight into the life of a superintendent as he had to complete daily tasks and solve any sudden problems that arose. After shadowing the superintendent we got out onto the course with the grounds crew to work on the course. We did anything that was asked of us with tasks such as shoveling aeration pellets off of the greens to changing pin locations or even raising sprinkler heads on fairways. And finally we played the course, although we were only able to play the public courses because the private courses couldn’t accommodate us with their schedule.</p>','<p>The most rewarding part of this project was knowing that this was a project that started from nothing. It was just an idea that really interested us so we ran with it and drew up the proposal and found the right contacts who were able to get in touch with the superintendents of the various courses we visited. This project was an exercise in networking and talking to people in the real world to gain experience in a field. Aside from the people skills we had to use the knowledge we gained about what it takes to maintain and run a golf course is invaluable. After this project we have gained a new appreciation for the work of the superintendent and everyone that plays a part in making the golf course beautiful and playable. The amount of work that they put in is grueling as they put in 60 hours or more per week during the height of the golf season. That work is not something we will take for granted going forward when playing golf.</p><p>Because of our great off campus advisor, Jim McCabe, we did not have any problems finding courses that were willing to host us. Once we were on the course the groundwork was tough but we knew what we were getting in to. The takeaway both of us took from this project was that people skills are one of the most valuable assets you can have. As the project progressed, our people skills developed to the point where we were no longer nervous about entering an environment with people we’ve never met, but were excited about meeting new people and learning everything we possibly could. The only thing that would have made this project more rewarding would be if we had more time to visit more courses. At each course we learned something new, whether it was why you need to aerate your greens or how you need to install drainage. Also, seeing a new course and the history of that place is just neat. With more courses we would have gained more knowledge and experience. We also would have met more people and gotten more perspectives on the job of the superintendent.</p><p>We would recommend this project to upcoming seniors as we gained valuable experiences and was interesting and satisfied our own curiosities, and that is really what the senior project is about.</p>');

My ISP was also challenging in many ways such as communicating with the students. The kids I worked with were as young as three and it was difficult for them to express complete thoughts. At times they would also misbehave and I would not know how to respond to them. I would listen and follow the teacher’s approaches to learn how I should deal with the kids in different situations. From this experience I learned that I could make a big difference in helping a kid. I have realized that the little time I spent helping these kids means a lot to the kids and not only helps them learn but can urge them to help others. My ISP would have been more rewarding if I had spent time with different grades. I enjoyed working with kindergarteners but I would have preferred to work with different age groups to see how different ages respond and work. I would recommend this project to future seniors because if they are interested in teaching or child development it gives first hand experience.</p>');

We began by choosing a name and making the designs, which we had in mind even before the project began.  Our main goal by the end of the project was to produce a product that people would buy- which we did.  In the first week we focused on creating the website and finalizing the designs.  We also had to set up a checking account with Bank of America and pay for a business certificate, so that Ebb & Flow would be a legally recognized company in the state of Massachusetts.  Day to day we managed the company website, facebook, and twitter accounts, as well as took care of the aforementioned legal issues.  By the second week, we were finalizing our inventory selections.  We had spent a lot of time determining which t shirts and transfer papers we should buy and once we made our selections we had to wait until they arrived.  In the second week we also finalized the website and established a secure payment method for our online customers.  In the third week we began to sell the shirts and heavily market our product.  We called, texted, facebook messaged, tweeted, and used other methods of communication to promote our company.  In the fourth week the t shirts and transfer papers had arrived.  Day to day we struggled to find the correct printer to print our designs on to the transfer papers, but finally we had access to the right one.  Only in the week after the ISP officially ended were we able to print on to the t shirts, thanks to our off campus advisor Chris Regan, and his commercial heat press.</p>','<p>We began our ISP with the goal of starting a legitimate business selling graphic t-shirts. In doing so, we learned a significant amount about entrepreneurship, marketing, and finance, all of which are key aspects in the business world. We will benefit greatly from the knowledge we gained of how to start a business as well as how to manage one. The value of work we put into Ebb & Flow, from obtaining a legal business certificate to setting up a company bank account will remain useful to us throughout our lives. </p><p>Unfortunately, similar to any startup, there were challenges that we had to overcome in order to make Ebb & Flow possible. After developing our business plan, the first major obstacle we ran into was the physical printing of the t-shirts. Initially, we were under the impression that Mr. Regan would provide both the transfer papers and the heat press necessary for printing the shirts. After learning we were responsible for the transfer papers, we set out to find ones that would be best for our shirts and the heat press. We then needed to obtain a printer that matched the specifications of our transfer paper. After trying various printing companies and trying to use Mr. Katz ink-jet printer, with no success, we learned that Henry’s father’s company had just purchased a new printer. Using this printer, we were able to print our designs, and later with Mr. Regan’s help, we pressed our t-shirts, completing our main objective. </p><p>We also learned a lot about ourselves during the process of creating, developing, and managing Ebb & Flow. Both of us will exhaust every option and re-do things over and over again until we have our product exactly the way we want it. We learned that we are capable of working together to discuss and implement solutions to problems easily and without any hostility towards one another. Most importantly, we were able to step back from our personal views and decide cohesively what action to take for the betterment of the company.</p><p>Our biggest regrets over the course of our ISP is the fact that we were not able to design our website layout with our own template. While using Squarespace for our domain and website design proved extremely helpful for both the time constraints of the ISP and our own financial constraints, we would have preferred to design, manage, and develop our own website from scratch. Otherwise, we felt that the experience of creating our own company was rewarding and extremely useful to us as young entrepreneurs heading off to college in the fall. </p><p>Both of us would, without doubt, recommend this project or a similar one to any RL senior. Starting a company provides you with indispensable knowledge that will help you on later in life, either in the business world or simply by giving you managerial experience. We found Ebb & Flow to be hard work and intense at times, but always fun, interesting, and extremely rewarding.</p>');

Then, I would spend the rest of my day evaluating prospects by watching their college games.

However, after undergoing this internship I learned that my future after college will most likely not be basketball related. I found this internship outrageously boring. I tired of watching games all day, and this type of watching was not the same watching as I''m accustomed to. This was tedious, and very concentrated watching. Perhaps playing, or coaching, might be different, because it brings the competitive aspect of basketball back into play, but this type of serious work took the fun out of the game I have come to love so dearly. However, there were parts of this project which I enjoyed greatly. I learned so much about the players to whom I look up. Their habits, their work ethic, their backgrounds, I feel like I grew to know them more intimately than ever before. There were things I liked, things I disliked, things that were similar to me, and things that were different. Most importantly, I found out how society, specifically the business world, viewed these young kids I had been idolizing my whole life.

While it may not seem like such a bad thing, this job would be incredibly boring after about 10 minutes of performing.  Nevertheless the job had to get done so that provided me the necessary motivation to get it done.  I learned that I really enjoy spending time outdoors, and to have the time to do it was really nice.  These days I feel like many people take the nature for granted.  To be able to spend 5 hours outside everyday was one of the best parts about this project, especially after a very busy couple years of my life where most time was spent in classrooms.  This project would have been more rewarding if I had come up with a specific project that I could have done outdoors.  If I had some more personal time to perhaps build something in the woods, then perhaps the everyday woodchip spreading wouldn’t have seemed so bad.  I would definitely recommend this project.  I’m glad that I was able to spend my time outdoors as opposed to sitting behind a desk working with numbers.  Also I would recommend it because I helped this organization out a great deal, and not many other students are able to say that.</p>');

We erroneously assumed that our off campus advisor would supply us with more than he did (an error on our part).  We needed transfer papers as well as a commercial heat press- but he only had the press.  When we learned about our shortcomings, finding the appropriate and least expensive method of getting our designs onto the right transfer papers was a hard task.  We spent hours calling different printing shops, watching transfer paper tutorials, scouring the internet for information on transfer papers in general.  The prices for custom transfer papers were astronomical, and so we focused our attention on bulk, printable transfer papers.  We found a fantastic company called Conde Systems that sold the perfect type of transfer paper at an affordable price.  Once we bought the papers, we still needed to print our designs onto them.  This turned out to be incredible frustrating, given the printer we thought we could use didn’t actually work when we tried to use our transfer papers.  It was only in the last week that we gained access to the right kind of printer, through my father’s company, and printed these transfer papers.  Chris Regan was incredibly helpful when it came to using his press, and apart from minor troubleshooting, we were able to print the shirts easily.</p><p>This project taught me a lot about business, but also about problem solving and how to work with a partner.  Zack and I were a great team, and we each brought different talents to the table.  His artistic skills combined with my practical approach to sales helped us grow our company most effectively.  Seeing an idea converted to a physical product that is worn by your peers is a very gratifying feeling.  Selling t-shirts may not sound like the most exciting ISP, but we turned our company from nothing to a successful business in just 4 weeks.  I’m proud of what we accomplished and wouldn’t  change much if I could do it all again.</p>');

Primarily these facilities handle water (e.g. Waste water treatment, water reclamation, pump stations, etc.). While I was in the office, I assisted the different engineers with their projects.

It was also a rewarding project because it allowed me to come into contact with many professionals in the engineering community and allowed me to learn from them, getting little tidbits that you would never get from a textbook. Though, a lack of textbook knowledge was one of the challenges I faced in this project. I had limited knowledge of the principals and formulas commonly used in the engineering field, so I had to try to learn them as I went along. This experience for me confirmed my love for problem solving, which is mostly what engineering is and strengthened by belief that engineering is something I will enjoy in the future. Though I was in the field a few times, I believe that more time spend in the field at various projects would have enriched this experience even more for me. I found being at the various projects, especially the Boston project (the firm runs a pump station in the south end) which I found very interesting as it prevents a large part of the city from flooding. I would recommend this project, or any similar projects to anybody interested in engineering and more generally how our vital infrastructures work. I would caution them, however, to ensure that the chosen firm would have real work for you to do and give you a change to be in the field.

I received a wide range of responses, from the immediate ‘not a chance’ (at a glassware and antique repair stores), to ‘maybe later’ (from a catering company and an upholsterer), and a few hesitant yeses (all from where I worked plus a lock and furniture repair store).  I thought I had everything all figured out until a week before I began working, when I again met with the people who had expressed more interest in an internship.  Three of the seven who had previously affirmed an internship, possibly at a later date, decided against the idea (including one where I had previously had a firm yes).  Fortunately, I retained four of the jobs that I had secured, though on my first day showing up to the cleaners/seamstress, the owner told me to go away (though he eventually relented after I promptly went next door the owner gave me a good reference).  I also entered these jobs with virtually no experience and needed to be shown almost everything in fine detail.  </p><p>More so than in any other month in my life, I learned an incredible amount.

Each internship was definitely worthwhile, though I felt that I never had the opportunity to dive deeper into a particular field.

I also spent a lot of time reading a book written by one of the associates in the office. I wanted to learn about the rich history of this place.</p>','<p>It was rewarding to volunteer for the Wrentham Developmental Center, because it felt like an extension of my previous work to be helping at Wrentham. Everything that they stand for, the rehabilitation and care for the mentally handicapped is at the core of my principles and my family’s as well. It was also rewarding, because I earned a summer internship at Wrentham Developmental Center in direct care. This will be an extremely different experience for me, and although I am a little bit nervous I think it will be even more rewarding than the ISP was for me. The most important thing I learned came directly from my Off-Campus Advisor,  Tony Marano. He told me a lot of important things that he has learned in his 30+ years working for WDC, but he claims interpersonal skills are the key to being successful at whatever you do. I emulate so many things about Tony; his care, his compassion, his humor, his pride, but what I look up to the most is the fact that he is a man who considers the well-being of the residents at every point in the day. I highly recommend this project, and I think more people would be interested if it were not in the far away land of Wrentham. The only challenge for me was leaving, but luckily I will be able to stop in and say hello to the office throughout the summer.</p>');

Timilty at the Massachusetts State House. During my time at the State House I shadowed Walter and helped him with a number of different tasks. I also worked closely with Walter’s chief of staff, Steven Teehan.  Tasks that I was assigned to do, included constituent correspondence, wherein I would help write email or letter responses to citizens of Walter’s district. In addition to the correspondence, I would also occasionally answer/make calls for Walter in order to reach out to constituents and also sit in on meetings with him and House Chamber sessions. My main goal for this project was to fulfill the Roxbury Latin creed of preparing men to serve the commonwealth. I do not believe there is any more direct of a way to accomplish than getting involved in state level politics. Being able to help, in whatever small way I did, gave me a real sense of accomplishment.</p>','<p>Spending my Senior Project working with Representative Walter F. Timilty at the Massachusetts State House is an experience I will truly never forget. What makes the time I spent there unique for me is the fact that I was participating in public service. This was extremely rewarding for me because not only was I able to give back to my local community by working with my district’s representative, but I was able to fulfill Roxbury Latin’s school missions as well. RL looks to prepare boys to serve in "Church and Commonwealth" and I was able to perform one of these missions by serving the Commonwealth during my project. While it was rewarding my project also had its challenges such as the long commute on public transportation everyday (not to mention putting my life at risk by taking public transportation lol). The real challenge of my project though, was staying busy. Rep. Timilty had just hired a new Chief of Staff, whose first day coincided with mine. This put the Representative’s office in a bit of a transitional phase, which left me with minimal work at times. I cannot say I learned much about myself as a result of this experience, but there are a couple things I suppose. I learned that I enjoy the city, especially downtown, right in the thick of things. Also I learned that Politics still do not really interest me. This project could have been more rewarding had The Representative’s office not been in a transitional state during the time I was there. I would recommend this project though, because even though I am not enamored by politics, this project could be great for someone who is interested in such things.</p>');

We recorded video footage from our XBoxes and audio footage from microphones.  Once all the editing and uploading was complete, sitting down and watching our videos on YouTube was an incredibly rewarding ten minutes.  That said, certain things about the project were far more challenging that we anticipated.  Setting up took a long time; it was not until Thursday of the first week of ISPs that we were able to record gameplay.  Recording was also much more exhausting than we would have thought.  Continually trying to take advantage of everything each game has to offer in order to create funny content was really tasking.  We would absolutely recommend this project; we had a great time and we learned a lot about editing and producing videos.  However, you need certain equipment, some of which is expensive.  During the process, we spent around $450 for adapters, game capture cards, and converters.  Most of this is unavoidable spending, and we happened to have a lot of the stuff we needed already lying around, so it could have been even more expensive if we did not already have headphones, an audio capture card, or a large selection of video games.</p><p>If a student wants to do this project, or something similar, make sure he really wants to do it.  Whenever teachers hear that our project is playing video games, they just laugh and shake their head.  In truth, this ISP was a lot of work, and we put in several hours of work every day.

My objectives for this project were three-fold. I wanted to gain skills and knowledge working in media, experience working first-hand in a media production environment, develop a better sense of whether or not media/journalism is a field I would want to work in going forward. At the practical level, I typically worked four days a week- Monday through Thursday, and about seven hours a day, with the exception of Thursday, which was about ten hours. Thursday was different because that’s the day we broadcast from the studio at WBUR. Most of my tasks entailed researching story topics and guests, taking notes on phone "pre-interviews," photographing interviews and guests for our website, and managing a broad array of social media platforms.</p>','<p>I am pretty satisfied with the way my project turned out. It was not exactly what I expected, but it was interesting and eye-opening, nevertheless. While I definitely satisfied one goal- practical experience working in a media production environment- I’m not sure if I succeeded in the other, namely whether I want to work in this industry beyond RL or college. It’s evident to me now that public radio in general, and Radio Open Source specifically, are a particular part of a more diverse industry, so many of my likes and dislikes about this particular work wouldn’t necessarily hold true across the board. That said, there was much to like about Open Source, and much of it was rewarding- everything from learning the workflow of a media company, to how to book and interview guests, and what kinds of conversations are good for radio. The most challenging part was probably dealing with the more menial assignments like transcription, and reformatting old posts, but I think even these small tasks helped further my knowledge and skills. Through this project, I learned about myself that creativity and an enterprising spirit are two essential qualities to success in this or any work environment. I found the most personal fulfillment and clear successes when I tried new things and offered my own ideas. That’s one thing I’ll take away from this: the importance of trusting myself even when I’m the least experienced or least senior member of the team. I would recommend this ISP to future seniors, especially given that Chris Lydon, as an RL alum, is very supportive of the school and RL students. That said, to be successful at this project you have to be able to forge your own path, and you have to have some level of interest in the cultural, political, and artistic topics that Radio Open Source covers in their program.</p>');

Best Bees Company is an organization that specializes in beekeeping services and operates out of the South End. Tutto Italiano is a gourmet Italian specialty store located in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood that produces gourmet artisan products. My goals were to explore areas of interest that related closely to my interest in horticulture. Having already garnered much information regarding old-world agricultural techniques, I was curious to explore beekeeping and traditional artisan cooking, since both activities help better realize the farm to fork philosophy. I had previously done a good amount of cooking (though I had never worked in a store or on a strict time frame) and had only read some literature on honey bees. Bees play an essential role in pollination that allows crops to reproduce and grow beyond a single season. Best Bees also produces all-natural honey comb and pure honey for customers. Tutto Italiano takes the freshest ingredients and champions the old world methods that make their Italian specialty products distinctly authentic. I learned a lot of technical skills in both settings and learned to be more efficient and to work cooperatively with other adults. I acquired a vast wealth of new knowledge in both subject areas and have further developed my interest in learning more in each area. While at Best Bees, I frequently worked independently. There wasn’t a strict schedule, and the other employees and volunteers were often quite busy in the field or with other projects in the lab. I build dozens of hives and hundreds of frames for hives and I also spent time in the on-site apiary learning about honey bee colonies and the structure of the super organism that is a hive. I spent hours discussing Bees, CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder), and the company with owner Noah Wilson-Rich I worked at Best Bees approximately seven times over the course of the ISP period, so it was not possible to become a fully trained beekeeper. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from the activities in which I could partake at the lab. At Tutto Italiano I assisted making bread each morning I worked at the specialty store. I made pizzas, filled cannolis, chopped onions, peeled lettuce, cored tomatoes, unloaded pallets of imports, made arancini, helped with sausage making, prepared roasted red peppers, baked cookies, sliced and bagged bread, and assisted in many other ways in the kitchen and bakery rooms. I expanded my knowledge of cooking, and learned a lot about how a small business operates. I was fortunate to be able to spend a great deal of time directly assisting Emilio Locilento, my off campus advisor, who began working at the store for his father when he was only fifteen years old.</p>','<p>I found this project very rewarding. I was able to acquire new skill sets and immersed myself in situations that I doubt I would have otherwise experienced had I not had this opportunity at the end of high school. I believe the greatest reward for me was finding a kind of environment in which I enjoy working. While I perhaps most importantly acquired new technical skills, I also learned a lot about what it means to run a small business. I rarely saw the founder of Best Bees, since he was often marketing and at conferences with potential customers, though when he was around we spoke in great detail for extended amounts of time. Nonetheless, the volunteers, interns, and employees were largely left to work on their own. The director of operations delegated assignments in person and via email, and workers were given responsibility to manage themselves. The company was only recently established in 2010 and is growing very quickly. Because co-workers were at the lab irregularly and infrequently, it was difficult to develop relationships with others in the lab. It was also somewhat difficult to find mentors at Best Bees because there was so much to be done all the time. Many of the other volunteers are Co-Op students from Northeastern who work at Best Bees part time. Nonetheless, I still met several wonderful people and learned a lot given the short time frame of the ISP period. The routine at Tutto Italiano was much more structured, and I found that I enjoyed that. The store has been operating since 1988, and the daily proceedings haven’t changed much over the past 25+ years. I found that with the repetition I improved significantly as a cook and quickly found myself developing good technique. I learned quickly and felt more of a sense of accomplishment for my efforts. It was fascinating to experience Tutto Italiano from behind the counter and realize the difficulties such businesses encounter when dealing with the general public. I think that if I specialized exclusively at Tutto Italiano I would have learned even more. I spent most of my time helping in the kitchen and bakery, but frequently accompanied Emilio as well to get a sense of what it takes to manage a small business. Emilio frequently works thirteen or fourteen hour days, beginning hours before the store opens and leaving hours after closing. I enjoyed visiting a warehouse and selecting imported products. If I had more time, I would have enjoyed having the opportunity to visit a local meat producing company. I would have also liked to have had some more experience working behind the counter and actually working with the public. I was often present when representatives from different produce and meat companies came to speak with Emilio and his father Angelo and was able to listen to those conversations. I would certainly recommend this project, because while it did not meet all of my expectations or hopes, it was an eye-opening experience. Furthermore, at the conclusion of my ISP project, Tutto Italiano offered me a part-time summer job, so I will be continuing with them a few days a week until I head off to college in late August. I am very excited for this opportunity.</p>');

To achieve this goal we visited six different courses in the area, three public and three private, in order to see how they run their course. Like many things in life there are many different ways to accomplish the same task. This holds true for running a golf course. Each superintendent had his own way of using the resources at his disposal to attack the maintenance of his course. In order to learn what these superintendents do on a daily basis we shadowed them for a day or two depending on the course. This gave us great insight into the life of a superintendent as he had to complete daily tasks and solve any sudden problems that arose. After shadowing the superintendent we got out onto the course with the grounds crew to work on the course. We did anything that was asked of us with tasks such as shoveling aeration pellets off of the greens to changing pin locations or even raising sprinkler heads on fairways.

The differences between each course, especially the public vs private ones, were interesting. The biggest challenge was getting in touch with the courses. We were constantly changing our plans and schedule throughout the project. The connections through our off campus advisors made the project possible though. I learned that I have always taken the game of golf for granted. Golf would not be possible without so many hard workers. It would have been even more rewarding if we had been able to meet more people in the business. However, I believe we got a lot of new perspectives. I would definitely recommend this project because we met a lot of people, learned a lot, and we were always outdoors and having fun.</p>');

Their story would allow us to lead a localized assessment of the patient and determined what would be the best course of action, which could lead to either a surgical or no surgical treatment. In the office I watched both the doctor and his assistant administer anti-inflammatory cortisone, synthetic synovial fluid and empty needles to drain swelling. In addition to being a surgical expect I witnessed Dr. Weitzel act as a physiologist and try to understand each patient and give the patients the comfort that they needed. On operating days we would begin surgery at around 7 am. I was able to be in the room and watch surgeries ranging from routine meniscectomy, to an ACL repair and clavicle reconstruction. I also was able to observe Dr. Talmeo, a joint replacement specialist, replace a hip and knee. My goals were to witness the day-to-day life of an orthopedic surgeon to begin to see if I would pursue the occupation of surgeon in college. My experience was both practical and exhilarating and has allowed me to amass a passion for surgery and more of an idea of what I plan on studying in college.</p>','<p>My project, Shadowing an orthopedic surgeon, allowed me to foster a passion for the occupation of surgery which is currently motivating me to work hard in academia and to pursue any and all opportunities that will help me eventually meet the goal of being able to help people who cannot help themselves. It was extremely rewarding to witness patients who first came in hopeless and in excruciating pain, receive a diagnosis, undergo surgery then come back to the clinic post operation calling Dr. Weitzel an angel for allowing them to live their life just as they did pre injury without pain.  Sadly there are patients that Dr. Weitzel has to make understand that they will not get any better and have to live with the ailment. Still, he makes their suffering much less and helps them the best he can.  I learned that I want to be in the place where I can tell someone that it is going to be ok and for him or her to trust me to help him or her as best I can. My only regret is that I wish I had more time to follow Dr. Weitzel and witness more stories and observe the people improve through Dr. Weitzel’s help. The most challenging part of this project was the morning commute. I learned that when I am older I am going to live as close to my occupation as possible.  I would highly recommend this project to anyone interested in the medical field because I was able to learn in the small sense a good amount about orthopedics of the shoulder and knee, but in the large sense I was able to learn about a field that most people are not able to view and realize how rewarding and entertaining it could be.</p>');

Farm to Table is a growing concept in food services where sustainable farms can supply more directly to consumers. The first half of the documentary takes place at American Provisions, a small, local goods shop in South Boston, where I have worked for the past year and a half. The shop acts as a medium for local farms to access local consumers, and I explored how they act in this part of the Farm to Table process. The second half of the documentary explores Vermont Creamery, a small but growing creamery in Websterville, VT. Vermont Creamery is celebrating it’s 30th year in business now, and they were pioneers of Farm to Table, specifically in goat cheese crafting. They buy their milk from local farms around New England, and I also spent time at Ayers Brook Goat Dairy farm, also in Vermont. For filming, I used my Nikon D7000, almost always with my 35mm f/1.8 lens. I also used a RØDE Videomic for audio. I also spent time building a studio light with 8 CFL lightbulbs that I used for interviews. At these three locations, I shot interviews with the people who work there, totaling 8 interviews on camera, each lasting 10-15 minutes. Interview questions consisted of general ones, such as "What is your job here?", "How did you start working here?", etc. They also consisted of more specific questions to the persons role in the Farm to Table scene. The last question for each interview was "What does Farm to Table mean to you?". I felt that a question that directly hit the target of what I am aiming to capture would yield fantastic answers, and they did. For the first two and a half weeks, I spent time filming these interviews, as well as b-roll. After filming, each interview was also transcribed. After transcribing an interview, I "highlighted" them. This means that I went through and chose segments that could stand alone in the documentary and would be added. Using these highlighted lines, usually 20-or-so per interview, I was able to storyboard the documentary. I created segments, which would be building blocks to my film, and each highlighted line would be added to one of the segments. Then I begun editing using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, a program which I knew well going in. I referenced the storyboard, as well as a catalogue I made of all the b-roll I captured throughout the process, to start from the beginning and add footage as I went. This period really did consist of being at my computer for hours, whether it was trying to fix audio or make a transition smoother. My goal of finishing the documentary was accomplished, and I was happy that I could see the Farm to Table idea in many different lights, and see how the people really making it happen on different sides interacted.</p>','<p>Easily, the thing that is most rewarding about this project was the fact that I am walking away with a finished product with my name on it. Everything from graphic design, to audio control, to interview transcribing, was work that I did to make the final film what it is. Also, in the editing process, I was physically able to see the project make it’s way towards completion. How quickly the project would be finished was completely up to my own ability to be efficient and disciplined. Another reward of this project was the chance to head north to Vermont Creamery. I met some fantastic people there, most of whom I interviewed for the film. It was great to go up there and really see the craft behind a lot of different cheeses that I have been eating for a while. While there were rewards, there were also certain challenges. First, audio. I own a shotgun microphone that I attached to the top of my DSLR, and the quality was fantastic. However, it was not wise of me to film some interviews in busy places, where there would be an excess of background noise. I had to learn how to use the audio EQ and Highpass effects in Premiere to rid of some of the noise, and while it made the quality significantly better, it still was not all it could have been, and still may be noticeable. Another challenge was timing. I don’t think I accurately predicted the amount of time it would take to edit. I’d estimate now that 1 minute of the video is equivalent to about an hour of editing. This is due fixing audio quality, making better transitions, and referencing my storyboard an b-roll catalogue to put pieces together. Along with editing, transcribing interviews, cataloguing all of my shots, and general organization took up a large chunk of my time. I learned more about my own work ethic during this project than I have throughout schoolwork. Throughout the four weeks, there are no deadlines, only the ones you set for yourself. Being able to make sure I was on top of things helped me to learn how being organized increases my efficiency. Every file I had was catalogued in some way, including movie files, text documents, etc. I planned everything I did and wrote it out, kept that document, and referenced it. Being organized helped me to solve my problems by myself, and not lose anything. Missing files was never a problem for me, and I’m glad that I could avoid any loss of footage. To have made this project more rewarding, I wish that I had watched more short independent documentaries beforehand. It would have helped to give me a sense of timing within the film, and to be able to draw inspiration from the small parts of film (i.e. when b-roll should be shown to smooth over transitions, how long titles should last, etc.) At times, I felt too independent on the project, and questions on video editing could only be answered by my own research. Making a documentary is certainly a project I would recommend. I think that a decent amount of knowledge on video editing and cinematography is necessary, otherwise it would be too difficult to jump right into an unknown area. I could not be happier with my decision to make this documentary, and I love that I am walking away with my film.</p>');

At the start of the project, I shadowed Mr. Bilodeau to meetings and skype conversations. I learned about the operations and the challenges the NGO faced. We talked a lot about restricted vs unrestricted money and how unrestricted capital stretched the NGO too thin. We talked about the how the programs set their goals and determine their success. I also read The End of Poverty and Mountains beyond Mountains which helped me better understand the milieu of the organization.

I helped them with their media and wrote a report on how they can get high school students more involved in their efforts.</p>','<p>My time working with Medicines for Humanity was very informative and interesting. I started by reading The End of Poverty and Mountains Beyond Mountains. These books allowed me to understand the environment of NGO and better understand the conditions of these third world counties and the problems that the NGOs face. Reading these books also allowed me to get a glimpse of bigger problem – the root cause of child mortality and malnutrition, such as government instability and economic hardship. </p><p>I sat in on a lot of meetings. The first big meeting was a quarterly meeting in Africa. The entire crew in Rockland was on the call. They talked about the problems they are facing in Rwanda and how to transition out of Rwanda if the funding runs dry. They also talked about Cameroon and the successes achieved in that area. Another big talking point was South Sudan and the trouble getting to the project as a result of all the violence in the area. Hearing these problems was interesting and new to me. I started to realize the impact of these external forces on the welfare of the project. Voodoo Medicine was a problem in Kenya that kept many people from taking their daily medicine. I next sat in on a development meeting and learned about that side of the organization. I never realized how complicated and strategic it is to target donors. For each donor, MFH must thank them initially after receiving and donation and then must give them updates during the year to let them know what their money has been accomplishing. MFH must do all of this while also trying to target new donors. Their goal is to grow the donor revenue by 25% each year. I was very interested in how the NGO attracts donors. The process was a little less exciting than I thought it would be. Instead of selling your mission to the donor, in most cases, the donor asks to see proposals from many NGOs and will choose which NGO to donate his money towards. The strategic part of the development office is to target donors that are likely to donate, but also like to donate large amounts of capital. I helped the organization prioritize their target donor list by filtering out organizations that might not be as likely to donate. For example, some donors only donate to Christians affiliated NGOs, so they are less likely to donate to MFH. That donor would be placed at the bottom of the list. Updating the donor list was a little tedious, but MFH appreciated my work and it will help them save time in the future.</p><p>My next project was writing a proposal about how MFH could better engage High School students. My proposal included ideas such as student ambassadors, athlete ambassadors, school sponsorships and assigned reading.  I thought about the RL experience and how MFH could most effectively get involved. This project was alright – a little simple and plain, but necessary. I watched a lot of videos about MFH projects and told Tim which ones I thought were most effective in grabbing the attention of teens.  We created a plan to try to get RL students and students in other schools to start a MFH club that would meet monthly with Tim and project managers to discuss goals and events.</p><p>Overall, I got a lot out of this month. I learned about how NGO works and how difficult it is to run these operations. I also became more aware of the problems around the world, specifically how environmental, political and economic factors affect the welfare of people all across the world. Looking at the progress report in Haiti, I could see the extent of the problem – roughly 20% of children are undernourished many have parasites and the ease it which one can treat these ailments. Anti-parasite medication cost as little as 8 cents. I would definitely recommend this ISP because I learned so much and feel a little more knowledgeable about the world we live in and the solutions to improve it.</p>');

I was also invited to join the ENE staff on several meetings, usually one per week, to get a taste of what it was that they did. In addition, I was also a part of several inter-office conference calls each week. At the end of my time, I began focusing on the topic of energy storage, so I began researching the topic exclusively. To culminate my time at ENE, I wrote Peter a memo outlining several ideas and topics to be explored in an energy storage study he was seeking to initiate with other environmental groups. On a final note, Mrs. Carroll was instrumental in making this ISP happen, as she is the chairwoman of the board of ENE.</p>','<p>This past month, I interned at Environment Northeast, a small, non-profit environmental research and advocacy group, located on Tremont Street in Government Center. As someone who has a strong interest in public policy, and a newfound interest in environmental science, I believe my ISP at ENE was an appropriate choice. </p><p>Overall, I enjoyed my time working at ENE. I had an opportunity to learn a lot of things about different topics that would otherwise remain a unknown to me, such as various business models of the utility industry, important environmental regulations, and the technical details of several promising energy technologies. In addition to these facts, I also learned general professional skills from working in an office and attending meetings with various organizations. It was also inspiring to work in an environment with so many talented and intelligent people who were so clearly dedicated to environmental causes.</p><p>While I enjoyed my time at ENE for the most part, I did occasionally feel that some of the work was tedious. I found some of the reports I was asked to look over to be incredibly dense, especially for someone with no technical or policy background. Sixty pages seemed to be the number of choice for the consultants writing these studies, and they were pretty exhaustive. Unfortunately, they could be exhausting to read. But all in all, I learned a lot from reading so much, and I think it was an eye-opening experience to have, particularly for someone hoping to work in government/public policy later in life.</p><p>In conclusion, while I would not recommend this ISP to anyone not interested in the fields of environmental studies/public policy, I would strongly encourage someone who is to do so. For me, it was a fun and rewarding experience, and I was glad to have done it.</p>');

I want to show the beauty of the alleys from many different angles. I also want to work on my post-production skills of my photos. I want to work on different techniques and see how that changes the photo and my study of the alleyways. At the end of the month, I will have a photobook of all my photos.

I was able to work with Lightroom and Photoshop everyday which was useful for my photos, but this skill can be useful later on in a work space. I became really comfortable with these programs which will also improve my photography in the future. Lastly, I gained a deeper appreciation for photography as an artform. I always believed that photography was an artform, but I thought photography was different than a painting or a sculpture. I never used photography to describe an idea, I only used to take photos for enjoyment and documentation. I took photos to show the idea of a desert in a city.

The skills that I gained from this project have been rewarding and will be useful in the future. One thing that would make the project a little more rewarding is personal interaction.

My goals at the onset of the project were threefold: to develop and hone the skills necessary to shoot and edit high quality photographs, to spend a significant amount of time in nature taking pictures, and to develop and print several of my best photographs. Additionally, I wanted to work on a project that offered a flexible schedule and an opportunity to create my own hours. Essentially, I wanted to avoid a traditional five hour day, five days a week internship in an office building. I cannot share what a routine day would entail, as each week would bring different goals and timetables. Instead of working from mid-morning to mid-afternoon each day, I would vary my schedule, including some work done during nights, weekends, and after the project was scheduled to end. I consider my experience a success in all regards, as I thoroughly enjoyed the project and accomplished my three major goals.</p>','<p>I am very happy with my Independent Senior Project experience. After years of Roxbury Latin’s intense academics and months of a stressful college application process, I did not want an overly technical or intellectual project. Instead, I sought a creative project, and one that would allow me to create my own hours, as well as spend time outside. I wanted to avoid being in a cubicle doing intern work at all costs, and sought to pick a project that was as different from this situation as possible. I have very limited artistic talents, so a lot of creative options-like making an album or painting watercolor pictures-were not at my disposal. Luckily for me, my father is an avid amateur photographer, so not only did I have the idea to pursue photography, but I also had the necessary equipment and resources in my own home.</p><p>The project was challenging for three main reasons. Primarily, self-motivation can be an issue. Creating my own schedule was a welcome departure from high school, but it became very easy for me to sleep in or take days off, since no RL authority figure was monitoring my progress more than once a week. I definitely succumbed to a lack of motivation on certain days, but overall I enjoyed the project enough to self-motivate, and completed the necessary hours not out of obligation, but because I was having fun doing it. However, the project did become somewhat boring at times. Photography is fun, but after a few weeks I did become a little bit tired of it. Fortunately, I got somewhat of a second wind towards the end of the project, and finished on a high note. I should also add that sports and school commitments add a challenge to a creative, self-motivated project as well. During a week in which there are two days of hour long class meetings and three away games, it can be easy to slack off.    I enjoyed my project and do not regret my choice at all. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to any student seeking a creative outlet and a free schedule who wants to learn a skill, and who is able to work without the structure or authority figures present in a high school environment.</p>');

Our principal weapons of choice to accomplish this noble venture were the design programs, Pixologic zBrush and Autodesk Maya. Due to the obvious time constraints and the time-intensive nature of the project, our goal was to have a minute to two minute video which captivated our audience through its aesthetic beauty that displayed the wonder of animation. We decided to make it a first-person animation to add an interactive quality to our short. Our characters were modeled in zBrush while the setting and animation took place in Maya. Every day we would meet with our laptops and work from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm, with a short break for lunch at 12:00 pm. Shaan focused on designing the setting (buildings, environment etc.) and animation while Dennis tackled creating the character models and rigging them for movement. The first two weeks were characterized by a big learning curve due to the complexity of the software we were using, but we made consistent progress every day and started to really accelerate towards our finished product at the start of the third week. In the end, due to the time it takes to convert our animation file in Maya into a playable video, we have had to remove some aspects from the animation which we will present. We plan to forge ahead even after presenting so that we may augment our short with some finishing touches.</p>','<p>The most rewarding aspect of my project was the pride I took in my work after all my struggles and efforts. The ability to say, "I created this from nothing," is a feeling that I relish, and motivates my work. Regardless of the success of the buildings or the characters, the countless hours it took to achieve those results are point of personal pride for me.  </p><p>What I had originally considered as mainly an artistic endeavor, 3D animation turned out to be more of a technical challenge. Navigating through the complicated UI of the programs, and constant question, how do I do this, proved to be the major obstacles of the project. While the animation industry is a very specialized one, where on each project there may be 50 people only responsible for rigging, another 30 for lighting, 50 for animating, etc, my partner Shaan and I were charged with the task of performing all of these jobs. Therefore, the breadth of the project also proved quite challenging; we didn’t have time to focus on a particular component. </p><p>I learned that I am capable of learning what I don’t know. Although it sounds simple, this is a very important skill in life. In school, there’s always a teacher or a textbook to consult, but in the professional world, those resources may not always be available. I watched maybe 100 tutorials over the course of the project, finding and absorbing information to achieve my goals. And even then, there always seemed to be some problem not covered in the tutorial that completely baffles you. That’s when you just have to try random things, experimenting with the settings, retracing your workflow, etc.</p><p>The project would have been more rewarding if Shaan didn’t have to go to tennis practice every day for the first 3 weeks. Honestly, we did 75% of the work in the last 2 weeks (we worked the entire week after ISPs ended), because Shaan having to leave at 1 PM every afternoon really hindered our progress. </p><p>I would recommend this project for those who have an interest in animation and the amazing work they see in Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks movies. The project is an enormous task though, and involves a ton of independent planning, decision-making, and learning. </p><p>--</p><p>Over the course of these past 4 weeks, whenever we explained to an non-RL individual why we weren’t in school and what exactly an "Independent Senior Project" is, we always received a skeptical look or two. Granted, sending off languid 18 year olds on a project completely of their own design and under no one’s supervision but their own can be a tricky concept to sell over simply keeping them in the classroom. However in the case of our ISP, we experienced something we know could have never been replicated in the confines of a traditional classroom setting (as dear as that setting is to our hearts). Our project was about vision, a completely self-determined vision unique to us, and the fulfillment of that vision through our own initiative and self-motivation. It involved a onerous learning curve and plenty of late nights with eyes glued to YouTube, deciphering animation tutorials. It was characterized by the agonizing frustration of dealing with something wholly unfamiliar, innumerable "Crtl + Z" ‘s and the inexpressible feeling of achievement when a seemingly impossible obstacle had been overcome. Like any artistic partnership, it required the ability to compromise and the willingness to respect another’s opinion as much as you do your own. So in these ways, our project was very much a micro-representation of real-life. </p><p>Animation is one of those few fields that can truly claim to be the intersection of STEM and artistry. In that respect, it was an exciting foray outside the liberal arts-heavy education we received in our six years at RL. Furthermore, as budding engineers, this dive into animation provided us with a chance to test our design capabilities and use programs which are, or at the least represent, the kind of software that is a central part of the field. Looking back on the past four weeks, we find it immensely rewarding to be able to call ourselves animates when before (contrary to what we suggested on the ISP proposal forms) we had almost no clue what exactly animation entailed. The fact that we were completely new to this field was easily our biggest challenge, and as is the case with any project one is passionate about, we could’ve used another week or so to really polish our final product. However we recognize that while having the animation we originally envisioned would’ve been ideal, what really mattered was the learning process and our newfound familiarity with the captivating world of animation. We would enthusiastically recommend this project, but with a word of caution, as whoever undertakes it must be committed enough to the goal to not be deterred by unforeseen obstacles, which are almost guaranteed. We could not think of a more useful, satisfying and enlightening project, and, if given the chance to redo these past four weeks, we would not have it any other way.</p>');

I did this by sampling the various departments, trying to determine which best suited me and could most benefit from my help. So for the first part of my project, I spent a day at several different departments, including facilities, alternative medicine, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. After trying many, I decided to settle into a rotation among three of the departments for the remainder of my project. Each week, I spent two days at Adaptive Design, two days at recreation, and one day in a classroom in the high school. In the adaptive design department, I helped build a large wooden cabinet consisting of individual cubicles with power outlets and USB ports for students to charge their phones, tablets, and communication devices. In recreation, I helped the students participate in whatever way they could in APE (Adaptive Physical Education) class. In the classroom, I worked one-on-one with a student each Friday, helping him type a letter home about his activities during the previous week.</p>','<p>Working with the students at MHS was one of the best experiences of my life. I have learned that nothing stimulates me like helping those in need. The pain they endure and the adversity they face daily – and the positive attitude which many of them exhibit in spite of it– made helping them incredibly rewarding. Moreover, the school staff inspired me with their infectious commitment to their work. Beyond simply responding to the complaints and requests of the kids, they continually took initiative in applying their energy and creativity to make the lives of the students better. </p><p>I would strongly recommend this project. Nothing is so worthwhile as helping the most vulnerable among us. Working with these kids broadened my perspective and expanded my capacity for patience, empathy, and compassion. Furthermore, I truly enjoyed working at MHS. It was fun and interesting but not particularly difficult. The kids are amazing, the staff is amazing, and I had opportunities to do everything from woodworking to horseback riding. It offered so many enjoyable options, all of them helping an amazing cause. </p><p>The only thing I would have done differently is spend less time sampling the various departments so that I could have gotten into a steady routine earlier and had more time in the departments I chose. I enjoyed getting a taste of the variety at MHS, and I certainly learned from it, but the ISP is only a few weeks long so, in the end, spending too much time deciding what I wanted to do detracted slightly from my experience.</p>');

Earl on Mike and I decided that I would concentrate on one company that he covers while I was there, Dick’s Sporting Goods. I had two assignments over the course of the project, creating a pricing analysis and doing market research in the form of a survey. These were both useful and gave me daily activities, but I found the most value in the days when I shadowed Mike, especially during the time when his companies’ quarterly reports were being released.</p>','<p>I found this project to be incredibly rewarding, but somewhat difficult at times.  The biggest reward for me was insight into what really goes on at an enormous investment bank, and the culture there. Working with a research analyst, I could see first hand how hard people work in the industry and how stressful, and rapidly they have to react. However, research was nothing compared to what I saw when I visited the Sale’s department, and met people who get in everyday at 6 AM and work until they leave to go have dinner and drinks with clients. That was very eye-opening. The two major challenges of my project were the tedious nature of some of my busy work, and the fact that Mike had to travel a fair amount during my project, which sometimes made scheduling difficult, although it worked out fantastically in the end. Mike was great and really made this project worthwhile for me. It was especially useful as I learned that I still am interested in finance, although I am not sure in what capacity. I would highly recommend this project to anyone who has an interest in banking or finance, or thinks they might as early exposure can really help you decide if you do have that interest. Even if you’re not interested in banking, I would still recommend doing it just as an interesting project.</p>');

I have always had a curiosity in law, so I went into my ISP with hopes of learning more about the legal system, and gaining insight into the life of an ADA at the DA’s office and at the courthouse. I also hoped to watch interesting trials and cases. Most days, I checked in with ADAs Charlie Bartoloni and Gerry Ogus at the Courthouse. I would attend the Magistrate Session, where arraignments, probation hearings, and bail reviews are held. I would take notes on trial dates and bail amounts for Charlie and Gerry. I enjoyed the Magistrate Session because I got a quick taste of many different cases. I also got to see the defendents of various different backgrounds, and watch the lawyers in action. Afterwards, I would sit in on trial proceedings. Most days, I would watch the lawyers cross-examine the many witnesses called to testify. One day I had the opportunity to watch the defense attorney and prosecutor deliver their closing arguments in a vehicular homicide case. Also, through Dan Conley and the DA’s office, I was able to take a tour of the Nashua Street Jail and watch an autopsy at the Medical Examiner’s office.</p>','<p>During my time at the District Attorney’s office, I had the opportunity to sit in on trials, participate in the investigation process in the crime lab, and even visit jail and sit in on a full autopsy. As a whole, I found my ISP extremely interesting, fulfilling, and inspiring. The most rewarding aspect of the ISP was the access we were given. I was able to sit in on real trials, literally walk among inmates in a prison, and watch a full autopsy. On our last day, I sat in the juror’s box as Aaron Hernandez was arraigned. You just cannot beat that, an experience I will remember for the rest of my life. I thought the most challenging part of the project was the serious nature of the job – I had to wear a coat and tie everyday, and commute through traffic on the Pike early every morning. This was tough when some of my fellow classmates had more relaxed schedules, but I found that the experience was more than worth it. What I learned about myself also ties into what could have made this project more rewarding. Although I was an "intern," I did pretty basic jobs and I had to leave early everyday for sports. This isn’t a change that is possible during the ISP, but I wish I could have been a full-on intern. It frustrated me that I had to leave trials halfway finished to fill other school commitments, and I could not make myself fully-available to Charlie and Gerry. Therefore, I learned that I do not like to do things of this nature "part-time," and I think the experience would have been more rewarding if I could invest myself more fully in the internship. Finally, I would definitely recommend this ISP if you are interested in criminal law. Everyday, I saw trials and hearings about homicides, rapes, A&B, drug trafficking, and robberies – fascinating cases. If these sorts of things interest you, it’s a no-brainer. I found my ISP to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and I thank Dan Conley for making it all possible.</p>');

First, I wanted to see and experience the inner workings of a major newspaper. I’ve always been interested in the newspaper as a medium, and I was excited to pull back the curtain at the Globe. Most of all, though, I hoped to explore the world of Journalism, a field that intrigues me as a potential career path. </p><p>A defining feature of my project was its loose, mostly unsupervised nature. Although my off-campus advisor checked in often and made sure I felt at home, I sometimes had to make my presence known. This was perhaps the most challenging aspect of the project, and it manifested itself most clearly during the morning Editorial meetings. At these meetings, the columnists and editorial writers would go around the room, discussing and debating the day’s news items. Early in my project, I was content to simply observe the proceedings.

Daily activities, which took place mainly in the From the Top offices, included recruiting performers, securing a space, promoting publicity efforts, rehearsing pieces for the performance with other From the Top alumni, making programs and itineraries, and learning about arts leadership (which was accomplished through performance at the Boston Children’s Museum, and a visit to the Women’s Lunch Place, the concert’s charity of choice.)</p>','<p>For my ISP, I produced a concert of From the Top alumni in conjunction with Music for Food to raise money for a local food pantry. It was especially rewarding in contextualizing my frequent musical, extracurricular pursuits. It was extremely exciting to watch a concert grow from a notion into a reality, through hard work in production. It was great to see how a concert is made, since it puts a career in the arts in perspective.</p><p>Day-to-day work was sometimes onerous, and often extensive, and there were some challenges. One of the largest obstacles to success was the logistics of performers. Getting enough people to play and weathering last-minute cancellations in that regard proved to be more of a challenge than anticipated. In addition, for those alums (and From the Top staff members) that decided to form chamber groups to play at the performance (as opposed to playing solo), scheduling adequate rehearsal time, and finding a viable space was difficult. Scheduling dress rehearsals was another extension of this difficulty, and I, along with my adviser at From the Top, with whom I checked in daily, had to improvise a multi-dress rehearsal solution. Balancing the schedules of thirteen people, and straddling the line between informative and annoying in your attempts to get them to remember to respond to an email, or to confirm their repertoire, is a volatile and often uncontrollable act, which took a lot of patience.	</p><p>Another challenge was the publicity. My adviser, Shea Mavros, from From the Top’s education team, and I met at least weekly with the GM of Music for Food, Rob Cinnante, to work on publicity. He helped us put together a press release in conjunction with the From the Top marketing department. We sent the press release out to countless outlets, invited family and friends through email, created Facebook invites, and engaged in numerous other forms of promotion. We garnered a fair-sized crowd, but from the project, I learned that it takes an enormous amount of promotion to draw any number of people to an event like this.</p><p>Timing was also an additional challenge. Balancing my work email account and my home one, and finding suitable time to be in the office, in order to receive email replies and start new initiatives, could sometimes be a challenge. It was partly caused as an extension of the scheduling problem, as people are often hard to pin down by email when they are blitzed with logistical details.</p><p>I would recommend this project highly to anyone considering a career in the arts, or who values it as an important pursuit. It is important to see how much work goes into an event that maybe ordinarily, you would just show up and play at, and it teaches a valuable lesson about prompt compliance with concert organizers, because of the difficulty of the job, and its numerous moving parts. I don’t know how the experience could have been more enjoyable. I really learned a lot about myself in that it helped me see a different and important dimension to a career path I may be interested in pursuing.</p>');

It’s a small company that includes four employees: RL alum Mike O’Brien, his father Joe O’Brien, cousin Joe O’Brien, and Mike Habeeb. The goal of this experience was to get in behind the scenes of a small business. I want to study entrepreneurship in college and eventually own a small business, So going into college this experience was important for me. It is a boat shoe company so I dealt mostly with packaging orders, filling them, and sending them out right from the warehouse. Bob’s was a very specific company where they liked us to label every box of shoes they ordered, tedious, yet they are a very good customer. So I would do that, reseal the boxes, through on order labels and put them on a pallet ready to be collected and shipped out. I also fulfilled single orders by people from our website, packaging up a box of shoes or two and sending them off through fedex. Taking inventory and stock is also very important to a business, and something I took part in, as well as working on a memorial day ad campaign, editing shoes for our website, and building the warehouse store. It was a very rewarding experience being able to deal with everything on this side of the business world.</p>','<p>Working behind the scenes of a small business like Island Surf was rewarding in many different ways, and an overall unbelievable experience. The company consists of four employees so it felt like a small startup, even though the company has been off the ground for quite a while. It was rewarding because I got to see how a small company works. Island Surf is not a major brand nor a household name therefore it’s a small entrepreneurial venture which offered a lot of cool, unique, round-about ways to do things. For instance running a shopping website where customers could buy shoes or explore inventory. Island Surf appears to run their own website all together, but in reality it’s not coded in by anyone, but simply designed using another website called shopify. I got to see how simple it was to take a photo of a shoe and edit it to make it presentable to a customer online and edit and present 5 pairs of shoes myself, I got to see the warehouse and run the warehouse like any business would. Taking inventory, restocking things, packing things up and fulfilling orders. And the final reward aspects were both building my own ad campaign for memorial day, an American Flag made of shoes, and building the warehouse store using all sizes and all colors of styles, as well as setting up a clearance rack for all samples, which was great to learn from a business standpoint, how to use extra stock and materials that are unwanted and still turn them into profit and in a way that would be more convenient and appealing to a customer as well. The only challenges to this experiment were getting my feet wet in the warehouse side of a business, I had no idea how a warehouse worked, how to edit, how to fulfill orders, label orders, or ship orders, which was all part of the reason I was doing this to learn and gain experience, so the hardest challenge for me was to learn, and learn from scratch, having no previous knowledge or skill. About myself I learned mostly that even though it may take me a while to get ahold of how to do things, to learn skills I didn’t previously have, and figure out simple tasks, once I get the hang of things I can do them right, and not only right, I can excel and do them well, and I also learned that I may very well enjoy studying entrepreneurship, because even though I mainly did a lot of warehouse work, to me it was still very enjoyable. The only thing that could have possibly made this project more rewarding was to see how finances are dealt with in this business, how finances are allocated for orders in and orders out, versus shipping costs, employees salaries and the like. Seeing first hand how the finances were allocated and handled would’ve been the one thing to make this job better. Overall I would absolutely recommend this ISP to anyone interested in business and entrepreneurship, just to see the warehouse, shipment, boxing, and advertising works first hand. Just to see how all the nitty-gritty works and runs, it offers great insight into the other side not normally considered "businessy" in the business world yet is just as big a part if not better. Its been a great experience as well as has given me some great experience, especially for my resume, and I’d take the opportunity in a heartbeat if I had to do it all again.</p>');

In working with a 5th grade class I got to spend a lot of time working closely with the kids which for me was the most rewarding part. I really enjoy working with kids and so this ISP gave me a great chance to do just that. My ISP was different from others in that I didn’t face any difficult challenges in my time, but there were a few things that I wish could have gone differently. First of all, I did a LOT of copying. I’m talking at least an hour just about every day. Nothing was worse than when the kids had MCAS for 4 days, though. MCAS is the standardized test that public schools in MA need to take, and during testing I was not allowed to be in the room. So basically for these 4 days I sat in the faculty room and copied, cut out, or filed away for about 3 hours each day. In doing this project, I learned that I am pretty patient with kids. I also got much better at tutoring kids. It is very different to go from tutoring sixies in Latin to go and tutor a 5th grader in finding the area of a triangle. I also learned that I can get along with kids pretty well; from what I could tell the kids genuinely enjoyed working with me. This project could have been more rewarding if I had had more one on one time with the kids. The first week I was there I got to meet with students individually to help them edit their papers, and this was probably my favorite experience during my ISP. However, after the first week or two I no longer had the opportunity to work with kids individually, which I regret. I would recommend this project or one similar only if you love working with kids like I do. Also, you do need quite a bit of patience. Finally, what made this project even better for me was that I was able to do it with a teacher that I am still very close with. I have kept her updated with what I’ve been up to and I have even babysat for her a couple times. It was great getting the chance to work with her again, so I would say if you have a teacher you are still in contact with it is even more worthwhile.</p>');

However, when you make something, even something small, that sounds good, it is so rewarding and all you want to do is continue working. Those little moments of achievement and self-satisfaction are what make this type of ISP worth it. Other people liking your music too is an added bonus.</p><p>Staying persistent is key - make something every day. There were many little obstacles that Jonathan and I had to overcome, many times when we could have just given up. We didn’t, because we were passionate about the music. Even though there was no one there pushing us or telling what to do next, we kept trying. We took a lot of small breaks and listened to music to stay fresh and inspired. We pushed through our mental blocks by taking walks in the woods to clear our heads. There was a lot of struggle to get to even our very humble level of production experience and knowledge. We will pursue our project further by producing music and DJing throughout the summer.</p><p>I would definitely recommend this ISP if you love music. It’s not an easy ISP if you want to get something out of it; I’d say it’s probably one of the hardest. But the result is that you create music that people like and want to dance to, which is pretty damn cool.</p>');

Based on this fact, I came up with the idea of constructing an Adirondack chair along with a small side table.  I believe that this chair will get much use and be a continuous reminder of my ISP.  My project was to build the chair and table from scratch.  This meant that I had to do all of the cutting, screwing and troubleshooting myself, following some loose plans.  At first, my project was slow because I had to acquire all of the wood and supplies.  After I had purchased the wood, I sketched out all the necessary pieces then began cutting them out.  After all was cut out, I began the construction.  The construction was really the fun part because it was enjoyable to watch the pieces come together into a final product.  In the end, I accomplished the goals of my project; making a reminder of my ISP, and construction useable furniture.</p>','<p>I believe my project was one of the more rewarding projects that students had.  I do not mean to say that other projects were not enjoyable or rewarding, I just mean that I was able to create a visible, tenable object that I can be satisfied with.  Specifically, I found the construction of the objects very rewarding.  As the pieces fit just right, I became satisfied with my work and knew that it was going to end well.  This is not to say that I did not hit any bumps in the road.  My project was riddled with small mistakes that I had to overcome.  For example, as I was cutting out one of the last pieces, I made a wrong cut.  This wrong cut was very frustrating because not only did I have to go out and buy more wood, I also could not start constructing the chair because I needed the piece to start. In the end, these challenges, although annoying at the time, only made the construction more satisfying and rewarding in the end.  On the surface my project does not seem to be one that would teach you about yourself but surprisingly it did.  My project tested my patience and taught me not to overreact to small problems.  In the beginning, when something went wrong, I became very frustrated.  Then I realized that this frustration did not help me at all and only hurt me.  Towards the end of my project, I did not get frustrated so easily and even enjoyed overcoming the obstacles I encountered.  I think this project could have been more rewarding if I had done it with another person.  I think this because it would have been more enjoyable to have some company and would have been fun to see who could make the better objects.  In the end, I would recommend this project.  I would recommend this project because it was a very rewarding experience and it was something different, something that you don’t get to do everyday.</p>');

In the end together we made a total of about 8 tracks, but many of which were just beginnings of ideas.  We only made a couple finished tracks, and of those tracks only one which we were proud enough to play at our presentation.  Those were the finished products that we produced, but along the way we also began to learn how to produce music.  On a daily basis, we would work on our track either separately or together, for most of the day, having a skype call or gmail chat with our off campus advisor, Peter Morrow, every few days.</p>','<p>We had a lot of fun doing this ISP.  We are both very glad that we picked a project that wouldn’t be boring for us (such as a generic internship or a lame job that was someone else’s idea).  This project gave us all the freedom and flexibility which we wanted in our project from the beginning.</p><p>What was very rewarding about this project was being able to go out and play our music for people and seeing them elicit a positive response.  Music is something that can transcend the everyday crap that we wade through.  What was probably most rewarding about this project was the friendship that was made and strengthened between us.  We weren’t the closest of friends at the start of this project, but as we worked together, and realized how much we had in common, and operated on the same wavelength, we grew very close.  </p><p>Honestly, there were many challenges that we faced, despite what people might initially assume about our project.  At first people would come up to us and ask very skeptically what we had done that day.  We would say we "worked on music", which would only make them chuckle.  What they didn’t realize that there was no way to truly explain the hours of work we put in, first learning how to use the software, then learning how to use it well, and finally learning how to get our creative artistic vision somewhat represented in audio form.  </p><p>We learned how to manage our time pretty well, and we were able to go the gym almost every day, even when things got pretty busy.  During our ISP music literally consumed our lives.  For Jonathan he literally had dreams about audio equipment, and about producing music on his laptop.  </p><p>If another duo of RL kids could experience all the crazy crap we went through on this project, I would totally approve of that.  However, it was mostly due to a very lucky meshing of two friends, hard work, and a very competent off campus advisor, which allowed us to pull this project off.  Without those elements, this project could have turned into complete garbage.</p>');

However, the path to doing so was not as straightforward as that sounds: each day, I would begin by drawing figures for 30 minutes, broken into three 10 minute intervals of 30 seconds a figure, 2 minutes a figure, and 5 minutes a figure. Moreover, I would read various comics at Marc’s recommendation to learn how to improve my own. Over the course of the 4 weeks, I would regularly create new layouts for each page, applying what I learned from the "required reading" and talking with Marc to further improve each page. At the end of the ISP, I condensed all the "experimental" layouts into a final 4 pages.</p>','<p>When I was deciding on an ISP, I took Mr. Buckley’s words to heart: this could be the last time I would be free to my own devices and I should use the ISP to pursue an interest I would otherwise never be able to. Naturally, the 12-year old in me jumped for joy: I would spend the week drawing and reading comics. I quickly realized that my project would be a lot more complex than that: I had never drawn anything more complicated than a few doodles, and while I have been drawing from a young age, I was certainly no professional. If I wanted to create a good project, I would have to treat this more like a job than unstructured free time.</p><p>That isn’t to say I didn’t enjoy the experience, I loved even more as a result. With Marc’s guidance, I found the perfect resources to not only improve as an artist, but also as a cartoonist. Instead of drawing whatever came to mind, I had to regularly do 30 minutes of figure drawing and upload the results to Dropbox for Marc’s commentary. Instead of reading whatever comics I wanted, Marc picked out specific works that were among the best in the medium. Moreover, he had me dissect my own art, seeing what was good and bad in it and how to make elements of it more effective. This process, while tiring at times, resulted in the best possible product.</p><p>Ultimately, my ISP was more rewarding than I had foreseen. I had all the luxuries of a stay-at-home ISP, but I vastly improved as an artist, more so than if I had a less strict advisor. Thus, I can easily recommend this ISP – and art-based ISP in general - to anyone, but with one caveat: only if it is rigorously structured. Because of the rather nebulous goal of just having produced art by the end of the 4 weeks, it would have been easy to just cobble something together at the last minute. But to make the ISP as rewarding as possible, it needs structure, just like every other ISP.</p>');

Our goal at the start was to complete five or six songs. As part of this we also wanted to include recordings of formal songs from Latonics repertoire. We did all the work for the project at Will’s house in Brookline using the programs FL Studio and Ozone 5 for recording and mastering respectively. We additionally used one of Roxbury Latin’s condenser microphones for recording. We worked most days from about 9:00 to 3:00, working around school commitments, namely the musical and sports. We ended up recording five songs, "Shenandoah" arranged by Marshall Bartholomew, Darius Rucker’s "Wagon Wheel" and Pharrell Williams’s "Happy" both arranged by Owen, "My Way" by I Fight Dragons and "The Keeper" by Bonobo arranged by Will.</p>','<p>The most rewarding part of our ISP was the realization that we had enough experience singing and arranging a cappella music to work virtually entirely by ourselves for a few weeks and end up with a product of which we are proud. We can listen to almost any radio station now and know that we could arrange and sing most of the songs played there, which is exciting and novel. The most challenging part goes hand in hand with the most rewarding: though we had become comfortable with the recording equipment and software by the end of our project, it took us a few weeks to understand how to work with them. We had the singing and arranging know-how at the beginning of our project that we needed, but actually running the recording by ourselves was difficult at first. Also, the fact that Will was sick for almost the entire second week and that both of us had time-intensive commitments early on (musical, track) sucked a significant portion of our early few weeks away. We learned a few major things from our ISP. First, we learned how to arrange and record music using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and a condenser microphone. Second, we learned how to plan and carry out a multi-week project with little supervision. Third, we learned what our skills and limits were with regards to singing and working with digital audio. The project would have been more rewarding if we hadn’t spent so much time in other commitments, allowing us to fulfill our goals more completely. We completed four songs, but we initially wanted to try to complete five or six, and given a week or two of time we couldn’t utilize during our project we could have come much closer to finishing our project in the way we wanted to at first (and possibly finish recording a mostly-recorded song we had to abandon because Owen was not in optimal vocal shape during the last two to three weeks). We would absolutely recommend this project to anyone looking for a culmination of an intense Roxbury Latin singing career such as ours. The project was immensely rewarding and we are excited to display our finished product.</p>');

Our principal weapons of choice to accomplish this noble venture were the design programs, Pixologic zBrush and Autodesk Maya. Due to the obvious time constraints and the time-intensive nature of the project, our goal was to have a minute to two minute video which captivated our audience through its aesthetic beauty that displayed the wonder of animation. We decided to make it a first-person animation to add an interactive quality to our short. Our characters were modeled in zBrush while the setting and animation took place in Maya. Every day we would meet with our laptops and work from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm, with a short break for lunch at 12:00 pm. Shaan focused on designing the setting (buildings, environment etc.) and animation while Dennis tackled creating the character models and rigging them for movement. The first two weeks were characterized by a big learning curve due to the complexity of the software we were using, but we made consistent progress every day and started to really accelerate towards our finished product at the start of the third week. In the end, due to the time it takes to convert our animation file in Maya into a playable video, we have had to remove some aspects from the animation which we will present. We plan to forge ahead even after presenting so that we may augment our short with some finishing touches.</p>','<p>Over the course of these past 4 weeks, whenever we explained to an non-RL individual why we weren’t in school and what exactly an "Independent Senior Project" is, we always received a skeptical look or two. Granted, sending off languid 18 year olds on a project completely of their own design and under no one’s supervision but their own can be a tricky concept to sell over simply keeping them in the classroom. However in the case of our ISP, we experienced something we know could have never been replicated in the confines of a traditional classroom setting (as dear as that setting is to our hearts). Our project was about vision, a completely self-determined vision unique to us, and the fulfillment of that vision through our own initiative and self-motivation. It involved a onerous learning curve and plenty of late nights with eyes glued to YouTube, deciphering animation tutorials. It was characterized by the agonizing frustration of dealing with something wholly unfamiliar, innumerable "Crtl + Z" ‘s and the inexpressible feeling of achievement when a seemingly impossible obstacle had been overcome. Like any artistic partnership, it required the ability to compromise and the willingness to respect another’s opinion as much as you do your own. So in these ways, our project was very much a micro-representation of real-life. </p><p>Animation is one of those few fields that can truly claim to be the intersection of STEM and artistry. In that respect, it was an exciting foray outside the liberal arts-heavy education we received in our six years at RL. Furthermore, as budding engineers, this dive into animation provided us with a chance to test our design capabilities and use programs which are, or at the least represent, the kind of software that is a central part of the field. Looking back on the past four weeks, we find it immensely rewarding to be able to call ourselves animates when before (contrary to what we suggested on the ISP proposal forms) we had almost no clue what exactly animation entailed. The fact that we were completely new to this field was easily our biggest challenge, and as is the case with any project one is passionate about, we could’ve used another week or so to really polish our final product. However we recognize that while having the animation we originally envisioned would’ve been ideal, what really mattered was the learning process and our newfound familiarity with the captivating world of animation. We would enthusiastically recommend this project, but with a word of caution, as whoever undertakes it must be committed enough to the goal to not be deterred by unforeseen obstacles, which are almost guaranteed. We could not think of a more useful, satisfying and enlightening project, and, if given the chance to redo these past four weeks, we would not have it any other way.</p>');

The mastering process also provided a number of hurdles in manipulating sound samples to fit the song while at the same time maintaining their integrity without clipping or popping. This process required a lot of focus at least in short bursts, which forced us to concentrate often, which was sometimes difficult with such an open schedule. This project would have been more rewarding if we had a better head start into the project, ie. more arrangements prepared and some experieice with the programs and equipment.

If we had gotten a faster start we would have warmed up sooner, allowing us more time in an efficient working state. I would certainly recommend this project to anyone interested in music, especially singing. This process lets you push yourself and your voice in a very casual setting. This project is also far better with two people, since a second person vastly streamlines the process, since one person can man the computer while the other sings and two voices add more complexity to entire songs.</p>');

As someone who is seriously considering pursuing business as a career, my primary goal and objective in taking on this internship was to get a taste for this side of business and see whether 1) business did seem like something I would want to do and 2) whether real estate might be a sector of the business world I might want to be in.  As for daily activities, I never really came into the office many days knowing what I was going to do.  For the most part I knew I was likely going to sit on at least a meeting or two though.  My other activities comprised of reading through deals, meeting with Mr. Elizondo to talk about real estate and some of the specifics of real estate, filing papers, and proofreading presentations.</p>','<p>My Independent Student Project interning at Long Wharf Real Estate Partners in Boston was a very rewarding experience.  For one I got to see that business does indeed appear to be a career that I would be interested in pursuing and could see myself doing.  Also, I got to learn a lot about a new face of the business world that I didn’t know too much about.  When I used to think of business, I always thought of stocks and bonds and what not, but from my ISP I got to see a whole new side of the business world, one that certainly appeals to me.  One of the biggest challenges in doing this project was just how tiresome it was.  Although I worked on my ISP less hours than I would normally spend in school each day, it felt much more tiring. On top of sports practices each day, I was completely deadbeat everyday by the time I got home.  One thing that could have made this project more rewarding is if I was more focused on the ISP during the one month I was a part of it, as opposed to having my time split between the ISP and sports.  I feel like the timing is much more strenuous for students who do a sport on top of their ISPs.  While the required hours per week is 25 (instead of 30), the amount of extra time athletes spend at school for their sports and travel time is probably between 12-15 hours...All in all, this is certainly an ISP I would recommend to others, especially if they are not doing a sport.  If they are, I would still recommend the ISP, just reminding whoever is contemplating doing a similar ISP the tiresome nature of the ISP itself.  I learned a lot from doing the ISP, regardless of how tired I was, and feel that others would be able to gain a lot from partaking in a similar ISP as well.</p>');

The dinghy is 7’ by 4’ and is made from a design simple enough for one person to build it in a month. My goal for this project was to gain experience with boat-building and woodworking, a skill which I had some prior experience with, but wanted to further, and a skill which is sure to come in handy many times in life. Also, I wanted to finish my senior project having a tangible outcome that was made from my hard work and my own two hands. The project basically entailed the gathering of materials and the cleaning up of the workspace during the first week, the measuring and cutting of the wood and the assembling of the boat during the second and third week, and then finally the painting and sealing of the boat during the fourth week. The biggest challenge was time management; at one point I couldn’t continue to build the boat until I could bend two pieces of wood, and in order to do that I had to wait a few days until my off-campus advisor was able to bring his steamer. Once I finished building it, I video recorded its first successful voyage out on the water so that I could show it in my presentation.</p>','<p>Overall, my senior project of building a Portuguese-style dinghy was very satisfying. I was able to construct something that I’m proud of with my own two hands, and I have a tangible result of all the work I put in during the past four weeks. I’ve also gained considerable experience with woodworking, since I’ve learned many tips and tricks for cutting and measuring wood, etc. Not to mention the fact that I have a boat now which I can take out on a lake anytime. The most challenging part of my project was time management. I had to think not just for the day ahead, but really for the next two weeks ahead, in order to follow my schedule for the construction of the boat. For example, at one point I couldn’t continue to build it until I could bend two pieces of wood (the gunwales), and in order to do that I had to wait a few days until my off-campus advisor was able to bring his steamer. Another challenging part was transportation; I had to rely on my mom to drive me every day to the garage that housed the boat, and she wasn’t always able to do that because of her own work. This is why I recommend for any future senior who’s interested in this type of project to build the boat in his own garage, if possible. As a result of this experience, I’ve learnt that I can be pretty handy with woodworking, and also that I need to plan ahead of time for serious projects and not just wing them. I’m not sure what would have made this project more rewarding for me, since I completed all that I set out to do and I’m very proud of the result. I would absolutely recommend this project for any seniors in the future because constructing something with your own two hands and being able to look at the summation of all your work is extremely satisfying. Building a boat also seems a lot more fun than doing an internship at a company or working at a school, because you’re able to set your own hours and do what you want to do each day.</p>');
